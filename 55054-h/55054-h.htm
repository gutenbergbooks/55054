<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>In the Preface to my former work, “Ancient
India as described by Megasthenês and Arrian,”
I informed the reader that it was my intention
to publish from time to time translations of the
Greek and Latin works which relate to ancient
India, until the series should be exhausted, and
the present volume is the second instalment
towards the fulfilment of that undertaking.
It contains a translation of the <i>Periplûs</i> (<i>i. e.
Circumnavigation</i>) <i>of the Erythræan Sea</i>,
together with a translation of the second part
of the <i>Indika</i> of Arrian describing the celebrated
voyage made by Nearkhos from the
mouth of the Indus to the head of the Persian
Gulf. Arrian’s narrative, copied from the
Journal of the voyage written by Nearkhos
himself, forms an admirable supplement to the
Periplûs, as it contains a minute description of
a part of the Erythræan Coast which is merely
glanced at by the author of that work. The
translations have been prepared from the most
approved texts. The notes, in a few instances
only, bear upon points of textual criticism,
their main object being to present in a concise
form for popular reading the most recent results
of learned enquiry directed to verify, correct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
or otherwise illustrate the contents of the
narratives.</p>

<p>The warm and unanimous approbation bestowed
upon the first volume of this series, both
by the Press in this country and at home, has
given me great encouragement to proceed with
the undertaking, and a third volume is now in
preparation, to contain the <i>Indika</i> of Ktêsias
and the account of India given by Strabo in the
15th Book of his Geography.</p>

<p>The <i>Periplûs of the Erythræan Sea</i> is the title
prefixed to a work which contains the best account
of the commerce carried on from the Red Sea and
the coast of Africa to the East Indies during the
time that Egypt was a province of the Roman empire.
The <em class="gesperrt">Erythræan Sea</em> was an appellation
given in those days to the whole expanse of ocean
reaching from the coast of Africa to the utmost
boundary of ancient knowledge on the East—an
appellation in all appearance deduced from the
entrance into it by the Straits of the Red Sea,
styled <em class="gesperrt">Erythra</em> by the Greeks, and not excluding
the Gulf of Persia.</p>

<p>The author was a Greek merchant, who in the
first century of the Christian era had, it would
appear, settled at <em class="gesperrt">Berenîkê</em>, a great seaport
situated in the southern extremity of Egypt,
whence he made commercial voyages which carried
him to the seaports of Eastern Africa as far as
<em class="gesperrt">Azania</em>, and to those of Arabia as far as <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em>,
whence, by taking advantage of the south-west
monsoon, he crossed over to the ports lying on
the western shores of India. Having made careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
observations and inquiries regarding the navigation
and commerce of these countries, he committed
to writing, for the benefit of other merchants,
the knowledge which he had thus acquired. Much
cannot be said in praise of the style in which he
writes. It is marked by a rude simplicity, which
shows that he was not a man of literary culture,
but in fact a mere man of business, who in composing
restricts himself to a narrow round of set
phrases, and is indifferent alike to grace, freedom,
or variety of expression. It shows further that
he was a Greek settled in Egypt, and that he must
have belonged to an isolated community of his
countrymen, whose speech had become corrupt by
much intercourse with foreigners. It presents a
very striking contrast to the rhetorical diction
which <em class="gesperrt">Agatharkhidês</em>, a great master of all
the tricks of speech, employs in his description of
the Erythræan. For all shortcomings, however,
in the style of the work, there is ample compensation
in the fulness, variety, accuracy, and utility
of the information which it conveys. Such indeed
is its superiority on these points that it must be
reckoned as a most precious treasure: for to it
we are indebted far more than to any other work
for most of our knowledge of the remote shores of
Eastern Africa, and the marts of India, and the
condition of ancient commerce in these parts of
the world.</p>

<p>The name of the author is unknown. In the Heidelberg
MS., which alone has preserved the little
work, and contains it after the <i>Periplûs</i> of Arrian,
the title given is
Αρῥιανου περιπλους της' Ερυθρας
θαλασσης. Trusting to the correctness of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
title, Stuckius attributed the work to <em class="gesperrt">Arrian</em> of
Nikomedia, and Fabricius to another Arrian who
belonged to Alexandria. No one, however, who
knows how ancient books are usually treated can
fail to see what the real fact here is, viz. that
since not only the <i>Periplûs Maris Erythræi</i>, but
also the <i>Anonymi Periplûs Ponti Euxini</i> (whereof
the latter part occurs in the Heidelberg MS. before
Arrian’s <i>Ponti Periplûs</i>) are attributed to Arrian,
and the different Arrians are not distinguished
by any indications afforded by the titles, there can
be no doubt that the well-known name of the
Nikomedian writer was transferred to the books
placed in juxtaposition to his proper works, by
the arbitrary judgment of the librarians. In fact
it very often happens that short works written by
different authors are all referred to one and the
same author, especially if they treat of the same
subject and are published conjointly in the same
volume. But in the case of the work before us,
any one would have all the more readily ascribed
it to Arrian who had heard by report anything
of the <i>Paraplûs</i> of the Erythræan Sea described
in that author’s <i>Indika</i>. On this point there
is the utmost unanimity of opinion among
writers.</p>

<p>That the author, whatever may have been his
name, lived in Egypt, is manifest. Thus he says
in § 29: “Several of the trees <i>with us</i> in Egypt
weep gum,” and he joins the names of the
Egyptian months with the Roman, as may be
seen by referring to §§ 6, 39, 49, and 56. The place
in which he was settled was probably Berenîkê,
since it was from that port he embarked on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
voyages to Africa and Arabia, and since he speaks
of the one coast as on the right from Berenîkê,
and the other on the left. The whole tenor of the
work proclaims that he must have been a merchant.
That the entire work is not a mere compilation
from the narratives or journals of other merchants
and navigators, but that the author had himself
visited some of the seats of trade which he describes,
is in itself probable, and is indicated in § 20,
where, contrary to the custom of the ancient
writers, he speaks in his own person:—“In sailing
south, therefore, <i>we</i> stand off from the shore and
keep <i>our</i> course down the middle of the gulf.”
Compare with this what is said in § 48: προς
την εμποριαν την ἑμετεραν.</p>

<p>As regards the age to which the writer belonged:
it is first of all evident that he wrote after the
times of Augustus, since in § 23 mention is made
of the Roman Emperors. That he was older,
however, than <em class="gesperrt">Ptolemy</em> the Geographer, is
proved by his geography, which knows nothing of
India beyond the Ganges except the traditional
account current from the days of Eratosthenês to
those of Pliny, while it is evident that Ptolemy
possessed much more accurate information regarding
these parts. It confirms this view that
while our author calls the island of Ceylon <em class="gesperrt">Palaisimoundou</em>,
Ptolemy calls it by the name
subsequently given to it—<em class="gesperrt">Salikê</em>. Again, from
§ 19, it is evident that he wrote before the
kingdom of the Nubathæans was abolished by
the Romans. Moreover Pliny (VI. xxvi. 101), in
proceeding to describe the navigation to the
marts of India by the direct route across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
ocean with the wind called Hippalos, writes to
this effect:—“And for a long time this was the
mode of navigation, until a merchant discovered
a compendious route whereby India was brought
so near that to trade thither became very lucrative.
For, every year a fleet is despatched, carrying
on board companies of archers, since the
Indian seas are much infested by pirates. Nor
will a description of the whole voyage from Egypt
tire the reader, since now for the first time correct
information regarding it has been made public.”
Compare with this the statement of the <i>Periplûs</i>
in § 57, and it will be apparent that while this
route to India had only just come into use in the
time of Pliny, it had been for some time in use in
the days of our author. Now, as <em class="gesperrt">Pliny</em> died in
79 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, and had completed his work two years
previously, it may be inferred that he had written
the 6th book of his <i>Natural History</i> before our
author wrote his work. A still more definite indication
of his date is furnished in § 5, where
<em class="gesperrt">Zoskalês</em> is mentioned as reigning in his
times over the Auxumitae. Now in a list of the
early kings of Abyssinia the name of <em class="gesperrt">Za-Hakale</em>
occurs, who must have reigned from
77 to 89 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> This <em class="gesperrt">Za-Hakale</em> is doubtless
the <em class="gesperrt">Zoskalês</em> of the <i>Periplûs</i>, and was the
contemporary of the emperors Vespasian, Titus,
and Domitian. We conclude, therefore, that the
<i>Periplûs</i> was written a little after the death of
Pliny, between the years <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 80-89.</p>

<p>Opinions on this point, however, have varied
considerably. Salmasius thought that Pliny and
our author wrote at the same time, though their ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>counts
of the same things are often contradictory.
In support of this view he adduces the statement
of the <i>Periplûs</i> (§ 54), “<em class="gesperrt">Muziris</em>, a place in India,
is in the kingdom of Kêprobotres,” when compared
with the statement of Pliny (VI. xxvi. 104),
“<em class="gesperrt">Cœlobothras</em> was reigning there when I
committed this to writing;” and argues that since
<em class="gesperrt">Kêprobotres</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Cœlobothras</em> are but
different forms of the same name, the two authors
must have been contemporary. The inference is,
however, unwarrantable, since the name in question,
like that of <em class="gesperrt">Pandiôn</em>, was a common appellation
of the kings who ruled over that part of India.</p>

<p>Dodwell, again, was of opinion that the <i>Periplûs</i>
was written after the year <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 161, when Marcus
Aurelius and Lucius Verus were joint emperors.
He bases, in the first place, his defence of this view
on the statement in § 26: “Not long before our
own times the Emperor (Καῖσαρ) destroyed the
place,” viz. <em class="gesperrt">Eudaimón-Arabia</em>, now Aden.
This emperor he supposes must have been Trajan,
who, according to Eutropius (VIII. 3), reduced
Arabia to the form of a province. Eutropius, however,
meant by Arabia only that small part of it
which adjoins Syria. This Dodwell not only denies,
but also asserts that the conquest of Trajan embraced
the whole of the Peninsula—a sweeping
inference, which he bases on a single passage
in the <i>Periplûs</i> (§ 16) where the south part
of Arabia is called ἡ πρώτη Αραβία, “the First
Arabia.” From this expression he gathers that
Trajan, after his conquest of the country, had
divided it into several provinces, designated according
to the order in which they were consti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>tuted.
The language of the <i>Periplûs</i>, however,
forbids us to suppose that there is here any reference
to a Roman province. What the passage
states is that <em class="gesperrt">Azania</em> (in Africa) was by
ancient right subject to the kingdom τῆς πρώτης
γινομένης (λεγομένης according to Dodwell) Ἀραβίας,
and was ruled by the despot of <em class="gesperrt">Mapharitis</em>.</p>

<p>Dodwell next defends the date he has fixed on
by the passage in § 23, where it is said that <em class="gesperrt">Kharibaël</em>
sought by frequent gifts and embassies
to gain the friendship of the emperors
(τῶν αὐτοκρατόρων). He thinks that the time is here
indicated when M. Aurelius and L. Verus were
reigning conjointly, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 161-181. There is no
need, however, to put this construction on the
words, which may without any impropriety be
taken to mean ‘<i>the emperors for the time being</i>,’
viz. Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian.</p>

<p>Vincent adopted the opinion of Salmasius regarding
the date of the work, but thinks that the
Kaîsar mentioned in § 26 was Claudius. “The
Romans,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> “from the time they first entered
Arabia under Ælius Gallus, had always maintained
a footing on the coast of the Red Sea. They
had a garrison at <em class="gesperrt">Leukê Kômê</em>, in Nabathaea,
where they collected the customs; and
it is apparent that they extended their power
down the gulf and to the ports of the ocean
in the reign of Claudius, as the freedman of
<em class="gesperrt">Annius Plocamus</em> was in the act of collecting
the tributes there when he was carried out to
sea and over to <em class="gesperrt">Taprobanê</em>. If we add to this
the discovery of Hippalus in the same reign, we
find a better reason for the destruction of Aden at
this time than at any other.” The assertion in
this extract that the garrison and custom-house
at <em class="gesperrt">Leukê Kômê</em> belonged to the Romans is not
warranted by the language of the <i>Periplûs</i>, which
in fact shows that they belonged to <em class="gesperrt">Malikhos</em>
the king of the Nabathæans. Again, it is a mere
conjecture that the voyage which the freedman of
Plocamus (who, according to Pliny, farmed the
revenues of the Red Sea) was making along the
coast of Arabia, when he was carried away by the
monsoon to Taprobanê, was a voyage undertaken to
collect the revenues due to the Roman treasury.
With regard to the word Καῖσαρ, which has
occasioned so much perplexity, it is most probably
a corrupt reading in a text notorious for its
corruptness. The proper reading may perhaps
be ΕΛΙΣΑΡ. At any rate, had one of the emperors
in reality destroyed Aden, it is unlikely
that their historians would have failed to mention
such an important fact.</p>

<p>Schwanbeck, although he saw the weakness of
the arguments with which Salmasius and Vincent
endeavoured to establish their position, nevertheless
thought that our author lived in the age
of Pliny and wrote a little before him, because
those particulars regarding the Indian navigation
which Pliny says became known in his age agree,
on the whole, so well with the statement in the
<i>Periplûs</i> that they must have been extracted
therefrom. No doubt there are, he allows, some
discrepancies; but those, he thinks, may be ascribed
to the haste or negligence of the copyist. A careful
examination, however, of parallel passages in
Pliny and the <i>Periplûs</i> show this assertion to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
untenable. Vincent himself speaks with caution
on this point:—“There is,” he says, “no absolute
proof that either copied from the other. But those
who are acquainted with Pliny’s methods of
abbreviation would much rather conclude, if one
must be a copyist, that his title to this office is
the clearest.”</p>

<p>From these preliminary points we pass on to
consider the contents of the work, and these may
be conveniently reviewed under the three heads
Geography, Navigation, Commerce. In the commentary,
which is to accompany the translation,
the Geography will be examined in detail. Meanwhile
we shall enumerate the voyages which are
distinguishable in the <i>Periplûs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the articles of
commerce which it specifies.</p>


<h4>I. <span class="smcap">Voyages mentioned in the Periplus.</span></h4>

<p>I. A voyage from <i>Berenîkê</i>, in the south of
Egypt, down the western coast of the Red Sea
through the Straits, along the coast of Africa,
round Cape Guardafui, and then southward along
the eastern coast of Africa as far as Rhapta, a
place about six degrees south of the equator.</p>

<p>II. We are informed of two distinct courses
confined to the Red Sea: one from Myos Hormos,
in the south of Egypt, across the northern end
of the sea to Leukê Kômê, on the opposite coast of
Arabia, near the mouth of the Elanitic Gulf, whence
it was continued to Mouza, an Arabian port lying
not far westward from the Straits; the other from
Berenîkê directly down the gulf to this same port</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>III. There is described next to this a voyage
from the mouth of the Straits along the southern
coast of Arabia round the promontory now called
Ras-el-Had, whence it was continued along the
eastern coast of Arabia as far as Apologos (now
Oboleh), an important emporium at the head of the
Persian Gulf, near the mouth of the river
Euphrates.</p>

<p>IV. Then follows a passage from the Straits to
India by three different routes: the first by
adhering to the coasts of Arabia, Karmania, Gedrosia,
and Indo-Skythia, which terminated at
<em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em> (Bharoch), a great emporium on the river
<em class="gesperrt">Nammadios</em> (the Narmadâ), at a distance of
thirty miles from its mouth; the second from
<em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em>, a port to the west of <em class="gesperrt">Suagros</em>, a great
projection on the south coast of Arabia, now Cape
Fartaque; and the third from Cape Guardafui, on
the African side—both across the ocean by the
monsoon to <em class="gesperrt">Mouziris</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Nelkunda</em>, great
commercial cities on the coast of Malabar.</p>

<p>V. After this we must allow a similar voyage
performed by the Indians to Arabia, or by the
Arabians to India, previous to the performance of
it by the Greeks, because the Greeks as late as the
reign of Philomêtôr met this commerce in Sabæa.</p>

<p>VI. We obtain an incidental knowledge of a
voyage conducted from ports on the east coast of
Africa over to India by the monsoon long before
Hippalos introduced the knowledge of that wind
to the Roman world. This voyage was connected,
no doubt, with the commerce of Arabia, since the
Arabians were the great traffickers of antiquity, and
held in subjection part of the sea-board of Eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Africa. The Indian commodities imported into
Africa were rice, ghee, oil of sesamum, sugar,
cotton, muslins, and sashes. These commodities,
the <i>Periplûs</i> informs us, were brought sometimes
in vessels destined expressly for the coast of Africa,
while at others they were only part of the cargo,
out of vessels which were proceeding to another
port. Thus we have two methods of conducting
this commerce perfectly direct; and another
by touching on this coast with a final destination
to Arabia. This is the reason that the
Greeks found cinnamon and the produce of India
on this coast, when they first ventured to pass
the Straits in order to seek a cheaper market than
Sabæa.</p>


<h4>II. <span class="smcap">Articles of Commerce mentioned
in the Periplus.</span></h4>

<p>I. Animals:—</p>

<p>1. Παρθένοι εὐειδεῖς πρὸς παλλακίαν—Handsome
girls for the haram, imported into Barugaza for
the king (<a href="#para_49">49</a>).<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>2. Δούλικα κρείσσονα—Tall slaves, procured at
Opônê, imported into Egypt (<a href="#para_14">14</a>).</p>

<p>3. Σώματα θηλυκὰ—Female slaves, procured
from Arabia and India, imported into the island
of Dioskoridês (<a href="#para_31">31</a>).</p>

<p>4. Σώματα—Slaves imported from Omana and
Apologos into Barugaza (<a href="#para_36">36</a>), and from Moundou
and Malaô (8, 9).</p>

<p>5. Ἱπποι—Horses imported into Kanê for the
king, and into Mouza for the despot (23, 24).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Ἡμὶοναι νωτηγοὶ—Sumpter mules imported
into Mouza for the despot (<a href="#para_24">24</a>).</p>

<p>II. Animal Products:—</p>

<p>1. Βούτυρον—Butter, or the Indian preparation
therefrom called <i>ghî</i>, a product of Ariakê (<a href="#para_41">41</a>);
exported from Barugaza to the Barbarine markets
beyond the Straits (<a href="#para_14">14</a>). The word, according to
Pliny (xxviii. 9), is of Skythian origin, though
apparently connected with Βους, τυρος. The
reading is, however, suspected by Lassen, who
would substitute Βοσμορον or Βοσπορον, <i>a kind of
grain</i>.</p>

<p>2. Δέρματα Σηρικὰ —Chinese hides or furs. Exported
from Barbarikon, a mart on the Indus (<a href="#para_39">39</a>).
Vincent suspected the reading δερματα, but groundlessly,
for Pliny mentions the Sêres sending their
iron along with vestments and hides (<i>vestibus
pellibusque</i>), and among the presents sent to
Yudhishṭhira by the Śâka, Tushâra and Kaṅka
skins are enumerated.—<i>Mahâbh.</i> ii. 50, quoted by
Lassen.</p>

<p>3. Ἐλέφας—Ivory. Exported from Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>),
Aualitês (<a href="#para_8">8</a>), Ptolemaïs (<a href="#para_3">3</a>), Mossulon (<a href="#para_10">10</a>), and the
ports of Azania (16, 17). Also from Barugaza (<a href="#para_49">49</a>),
Mouziris and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>); a species of ivory
called Βωσαρη is produced in Desarênê (<a href="#para_62">62</a>).</p>

<p>4. Ἔριον Σηρικὸν—Chinese cotton. Imported
from the country of the Thînai through Baktria
to Barugaza, and by the Ganges to Bengal, and
thence to Dimurikê (<a href="#para_64">64</a>). By Εριον Vincent seems
to understand silk in the raw state.</p>

<p>5. Κέρατα—Horns. Exported from Barugaza to
the marts of Omana and Apologos (<a href="#para_36">36</a>). Müller
suspects this reading, thinking it strange that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
such an article as <i>horns</i> should be mentioned
between <i>wooden beams</i> and <i>logs</i>. He thinks, therefore,
that Κέρατα is either used in some technical
sense, or that the reading Κορμῶν or Κορμίων
should be substituted—adding that Κορμοὺς ἐβένου,
<i>planks of ebony</i>, are at all events mentioned by
Athênaios (p. 201<i>a</i>) where he is quoting Kallixenos
of Rhodes.</p>

<p>6. Κοράλλιον—Coral. (Sans. <i>pravâla</i>, Hindi
<i>mûngâ</i>.) Imported into Kanê (<a href="#para_28">28</a>), Barbarikon
on the Indus (<a href="#para_39">39</a>), Barugaza (<a href="#para_49">49</a>), and Naoura,
Tundis, Mouziris, and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>).</p>

<p>7. Λάκκος χρωμάτινος—Coloured lac. Exported
to Adouli from Ariakê (<a href="#para_6">6</a>). The Sanskṛit word
is <i>lâkshâ</i>, which is probably a later form of <i>râkshâ</i>,
connected, as Lassen thinks, with <i>râga</i>, from the
root <i>raṅj</i>, to dye. The vulgar form is <i>lâkkha</i>.
Gum-lac is a substance produced on the leaves
and branches of certain trees by an insect, both
as a covering for its egg and food for its young.
It yields a fine red dye.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Salmasius thinks that
by λάκκος χρωμάτινος must be understood not lac
itself, but vestments dyed therewith.</p>

<p>8. Μαργαρίτης—Pearl. (Sans. <i>mukta</i>, Hindi,
<i>motí</i>.) Exported in considerable quantity and of
superior quality from Mouziris and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>).
Cf. πινικον.</p>

<p>9. Νημα Σῆρικόν—Silk thread. From the coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>try
of the Thînai: imported into Barugaza and
the marts of Dimurikê (<a href="#para_64">64</a>). Exported from
Barugaza (<a href="#para_49">49</a>), and also from Barbarikon on the
Indus (<a href="#para_39">39</a>).” It is called μέταξα by Procopius and all
the later writers, as well as by the <i>Digest</i>, and was
known without either name to Pliny”—Vincent.</p>

<p>10. Πινίκιος κόγχος—the Pearl-oyster. (Sans.
<i>śukti</i>.) Fished for at the entrance to the Persian
Gulf (<a href="#para_35">35</a>). Pearl πίνικον inferior to the Indian
sort exported in great quantity from the marts of
Apologos and Omana (<a href="#para_36">36</a>). A pearl fishery (Πινικοῦ κολύμβησις)
in the neighbourhood of Kolkhoi, in
the kingdom of Pandiôn, near the island of Epiodôros;
the produce transported to Argalou, in the
interior of the country, where muslin robes with
pearl inwoven (μαργαρίτιδες σινδόνες) were fabricated
(59). The reading of the MS. is σινδόνες,
ἐβαργαρείτιδες λεγόμεναι, for which Salmasius proposed
to read μαργαριτιδες. Müller suggests
instead αἱ Ἀργαρίτιδες, as if the muslin bore the
name of the place <i>Argarou</i> or <i>Argulou</i>, where it was
made.</p>

<p>Pearl is also obtained in Taprobanê (<a href="#para_61">61</a>); is
imported into the emporium on the Ganges called
Gangê (<a href="#para_63">63</a>).</p>

<p>11. Πορφύρα—Purple. Of a common as well as
of a superior quality, imported from Egypt into
Mouza (<a href="#para_24">24</a>) and Kanê (<a href="#para_28">28</a>), and from the marts of
Apologos and Omana into Barugaza (<a href="#para_36">36</a>).</p>

<p>12. Ῥἱνόκερως—Rhinoceros (Sans. <i>khadgaḍ</i>)—the
horn or the teeth, and probably the skin.
Exported from Adouli (<a href="#para_16">16</a>), and the marts of
Azania (<a href="#para_7">7</a>). Bruce found the hunting of the
rhinoceros still a trade in Abyssinia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>13. Χελώνη—Tortoise (Sans. <i>kachchhapa</i>) or
tortoise-shell. Exported from Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>) and
Aualitês (<a href="#para_7">7</a>); a small quantity of the genuine and
land tortoise, and a white sort with a small shell, exported
from Ptolemaïs (<a href="#para_3">3</a>); small shells (Χελωνάρια)
exported from Mossulon (<a href="#para_10">10</a>); a superior sort
in great quantity from Opônê (<a href="#para_13">13</a>); the mountain
tortoise from the island of Menouthias (<a href="#para_15">15</a>); a
kind next in quality to the Indian from the marts
of Azania (16, 17); the genuine, land, white, and
mountain sort with shells of extraordinary size
from the island of Dioskoridês (30, 31); a good
quantity from the island of Serapis (<a href="#para_33">33</a>); the best
kind in all the Erythræan—that of the Golden
Khersonêsos (<a href="#para_63">63</a>), sent to Mouziris and Nelkunda,
whence it is exported along with that of the
islands off the coast of Dimurikê (probably the
Laccadive islands) (<a href="#para_56">56</a>); tortoise is also procured
in Taprobanê (<a href="#para_61">61</a>).</p>


<p>III.—Plants and their products:—</p>

<p>1. Αλόη—the aloe (Sans. <i>agaru</i>). Exported from
Kanê (<a href="#para_28">28</a>). The sort referred to is probably the
bitter cathartic, not the aromatic sort supposed
by some to be the sandalwood. It grows abundantly
in Sokotra, and it was no doubt exported
thence to Kanê. “It is remarkable,” says Vincent,
“that when the author of the <i>Periplûs</i> arrives at
Sokotra he says nothing of the aloe, and mentions
only Indian cinnabar as a gum or resin distilling
from a tree: but the confounding of cinnabar with
dragon’s-blood was a mistake of ancient date and
a great absurdity” (II. p. 689).</p>

<p>2. Ἀρώματα—aromatics (ευωδια, θυμιαματα.)
Exported from Aualitês (<a href="#para_7">7</a>), Mossulon (<a href="#para_10">10</a>). Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the spices of Tabai (<a href="#para_12">12</a>) are enumerated ἀσύβη καί
ἄρωμα καί μάγλα, and similarly among the commodities
of Opônê κασσία καὶ ἄρωμα καὶ μότω; and
in these passages perhaps a particular kind of
aromatic (cinnamon?) may by preëminence be
called ἄρωμα. The occurrence, however, in two
instances of such a familiar word as ἄρωμα between
two outlandish words is suspicious, and this has
led Müller to conjecture that the proper reading
may be ἀρηβὼ, which Salmasius, citing Galen,
notes to be a kind of cassia.</p>

<p>3. Ασύβη—Asuphê, a kind of cassia. Exported
from Tabai (<a href="#para_12">12</a>). “This term,” says Vincent, “if
not Oriental, is from the Greek ἀσύφηλος, signifying
<i>cheap</i> or <i>ordinary</i>; but we do not find ἀσύφη
used in this manner by other authors: it may be an
Alexandrian corruption of the language, or it may
be the abbreviation of a merchant in his invoice.”
(<i>Asafœtida</i>, Sans. <i>hingu</i> or <i>bâhlika</i>, Mar. <i>hing</i>.)</p>

<p>4. Βδελλα, (common form Βδελλιον). Bdella,
Bdellium, produced on the sea-coast of Gedrosia
(<a href="#para_37">37</a>); exported from Barbarikon on the Indus
(<a href="#para_39">39</a>); brought from the interior of India to Barugaza
(<a href="#para_48">48</a>) for foreign export (<a href="#para_49">49</a>). Bdella is the gum
of the <i>Balsamodendron Mukul</i>, a tree growing in Sind,
Kâṭhiâvâḍ, and the Dîsâ district.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It is used both
as an incense and as a cordial medicine. The
bdellium of Scripture is a crystal, and has nothing
in common with the bdellium of the <i>Periplûs</i> but
its transparency. Conf. Dioskorid. i. 80; Plin. xii.
9; Galen, <i>Therapeut. ad Glauc.</i> II. p. 106; Lassen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
<i>Ind. Alt.</i> vol. I. p. 290; Vincent, vol. II. p. 690;
Yule’s <i>Marco Polo</i>, vol. II. p. 387. The etymology
of the word is uncertain. Lassen suspects it to be
Indian.</p>

<p>5. Γίζειρ—Gizeir, a kind of cassia exported from
Tabai (<a href="#para_12">12</a>). This sort is noticed and described by
Dioskoridês.</p>

<p>6. Δόκος—Beams of wood. Exported from
Barugaza to the marts of Omana and Apologos
(<a href="#para_36">36</a>). (? Blackwood.)</p>

<p>7. Δούακα—Douaka, a kind of cassia. Exported
from Malaô and Moundou (8, 9). It was probably
that inferior species which in Dioskorid. i. 12, is
called δακαρ or δακαρ or δαρκα.</p>

<p>8. Ἐβένιναι φάλαγγες—Logs of ebony (<i>Diospyros
melanoxylon</i>.) Exported from Barugaza to the
marts of Omana and Apologos (<a href="#para_36">36</a>).</p>

<p>9. Ελαιον—Oil (<i>tila</i>). Exported from Egypt to
Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>); ἔλαιον σησαμινον, oil of sêsamê, a
product of Ariakê (<a href="#para_41">41</a>). Exported from Barugaza
to the Barbarine markets (<a href="#para_14">14</a>), and to Moskha in
Arabia (<a href="#para_32">32</a>).<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>10. Ἰνδικόν μέλαν—Indigo. (Sans. <i>nîlî</i>, Guj.
<i>gulî</i>.) Exported from Skythic Barbarikon (<a href="#para_39">39</a>). It
appears pretty certain that the culture of the
indigo plant and the preparation of the drug have
been practised in India from a very remote epoch.
It has been questioned, indeed, whether the Indicum
mentioned by Pliny (xxxv. 6) was indigo,
but, as it would seem, without any good reason.
He states that it was brought from India, and
that when diluted it produced an admirable mixture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of blue and purple colours. <i>Vide</i> McCulloch’s
<i>Commer. Dict.</i> s. v. <i>Indigo</i>. Cf. Salmas, in <i>Exerc.</i>
Plin. p. 181. The dye was introduced into Rome
only a little before Pliny’s time.</p>

<p>11. Κάγκαμον—Kankamon. Exported from Malaô
and Moundou (8, 10). According to Dioskoridês
i. 23, it is the exudation of a wood, like myrrh, and
used for fumigation. Cf. Plin. xii. 44. According
to Scaliger it was gum-lac used as a dye. It
is the “dekamalli” gum of the bazars.</p>

<p>12. Κάρπασος—Karpasus (Sans. <i>kârpâsa'</i>; Heb.
karpas,) <i>Gossypium arboreum</i>, fine muslin—a product
of Ariakê (<a href="#para_41">41</a>). “How this word found its
way into Italy, and became the Latin <i>carbasus</i>,
fine linen, is surprising, when it is not found in
the Greek language. The Καρπασιον λινον of
Pausanias (<i>in Atticis</i>), of which the wick was
formed for the lamp of Pallas, is asbestos, so called
from Karpasos, a city of Crete—Salmas. Plin.
<i>Exercit.</i> p. 178. Conf. Q. Curtius viii. 9:—‘Carbaso
Indi corpora usque ad pedes velant, corumque rex
lecticâ margaritis circumpendentibus recumbit
distinctis auro et purpurâ carbasis quâ indutus
est.’” Vincent II. 699.</p>

<p>13. Κασσία or Κασία (Sans. <i>kuta</i>, Heb. <i>kiddah</i> and
<i>keziah</i>). Exported from Tabai (<a href="#para_12">12</a>); a coarse kind
exported from Malaô and Moundou (8, 9); a vast
quantity exported from Mossulon and Opônê (10, 13).</p>

<p>“This spice,” says Vincent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> “is mentioned frequently
in the <i>Periplûs</i>, and with various additions,
intended to specify the different sorts,
properties, or appearances of the commodity. It
is a species of cinnamon, and manifestly the same
as what we call cinnamon at this day; but different
from that of the Greeks and Romans,
which was not a bark, nor rolled up into pipes,
like ours. Theirs was the tender shoot of the
same plant, and of much higher value.” “If our
cinnamon,” he adds, “is the ancient casia, our casia
again is an inferior sort of cinnamon.” Pliny
(xii. 19) states that the cassia is of a larger size
than the cinnamon, and has a thin rind rather
than a bark, and that its value consists in being
hollowed out. Dioskoridês mentions cassia as a
product of Arabia, but this is a mistake, Arabian
cassia having been an import from India. Herodotos
(iii.) had made the same mistake, saying
that cassia grew in Arabia, but that cinnamon
was brought thither by birds from the country
where Bacchus was born (India). The cassia
shrub is a sort of laurel. There are ten kinds of
cassia specified in the <i>Periplûs</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Cf. Lassen, <i>Ind.
Alt.</i> I. 279, 283; Salmas. Plin. <i>Exercit.</i> p. 1304;
Galen, <i>de Antidotis</i>, bk. i.</p>

<p>14. Κιννάβαρι Ἰνδικòν—Dragon’s-blood, <i>damu’l
akhawein</i> of the Arabs, a gum distilled from
<i>Pterocarpus Draco</i>, a leguminous tree<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in the
island of Dioskoridês or Sokotra (<a href="#para_30">30</a>). Cinnabar,
with which this was confounded, is the red
sulphuret of mercury. Pliny (lib. xxix. c. 8)
distinguishes it as ‘Indian cinnabar.’ Dragon’s-blood
is one of the concrete balsams, the produce
of <i>Calamus Draco</i>, a species of rattan palm of
the Eastern Archipelago, [of <i>Pterocarpus Draco</i>,
allied to the Indian Kino tree or <i>Pt. marsupium</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
South India, and of <i>Dracæna Draco</i>, a liliaceous
tree of Madeira and the Canary Islands].</p>

<p>15. Κόστος (Sansk. <i>kushṭa</i>, Mar. <i>choka</i>, Guj.
<i>kaṭha</i> and <i>pushkara mûla</i>,)—Kostus. Exported
from Barbarikon, a mart on the Indus (<a href="#para_39">39</a>), and
from Barugaza, which procured it from Kâbul
through Proklaïs, &amp;c. This was considered the
best of aromatic roots, as nard or spikenard was
the best of aromatic plants. Pliny (xii. 25) describes
this root as hot to the taste and of consummate
fragrance, noting that it was found at
the head of Patalênê, where the Indus bifurcates
to form the Delta, and that it was of two sorts,
black and white, black being of an inferior quality.
Lassen states that two kinds are found in
India—one in Multân, and the other in Kâbul and
Kâśmîr. “The Costus of the ancients is still
exported from Western India, as well as from
Calcutta to China, under the name of <i>Putchok</i>, to
be burnt as an incense in Chinese temples. Its
identity has been ascertained in our own days by
Drs. Royle and Falconer as the root of a plant
which they called <i>Aucklandia Costus</i>....
Alexander Hamilton, at the beginning of last century,
calls it <i>ligna dulcis</i> (sic), and speaks of it as an
export from Sind, as did the author of the <i>Periplûs</i>
1600 years earlier.” Yule’s <i>Marco Polo</i>, vol. II.
p. 388.</p>

<p>16. Κρόκος—Crocus, Saffron. (Sans. <i>kaśmîraja</i>,
Guj. <i>kesir</i>, Pers. <i>zafrân</i>.) Exported from Egypt to
Mouza (<a href="#para_24">24</a>) and to Kanê (<a href="#para_28">28</a>).</p>

<p>17. Κύπερος—Cyprus. Exported from Egypt to
Mouza (<a href="#para_24">24</a>). It is an aromatic rush used in medicine
(Pliny xxi. 18). Herodotos (iv. 71) describes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
it as an aromatic plant used by the Skythians
for embalming. Κύπερος is probably Ionic for
Κύπειρος—Κύπειρος ἰνδικὸς of Dioskoridês, and
<i>Cypria herba indica</i> of Pliny.—Perhaps Turmeric,
<i>Curcuma longa</i>, or Galingal possibly.</p>

<p>18. Λέντια, (Lat. <i>lintea</i>)—Linen. Exported from
Egypt to Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>).</p>

<p>19. Λίβανος (Heb. <i>lebonah</i>, Arab. <i>luban</i>, Sans.
<i>śrîvâsa</i>)—Frankincense. Peratic or Libyan frankincense
exported from the Barbarine markets—Tabai
(<a href="#para_12">12</a>), Mossulon (<a href="#para_10">10</a>), Malaô and Moundou, in
small quantities (8, 9); produced in great abundance
and of the best quality at Akannai (<a href="#para_11">11</a>);
Arabian frankincense exported from Kanê (<a href="#para_28">28</a>). A
magazine for frankincense on the Sakhalitic Gulf
near Cape Suagros (<a href="#para_30">30</a>). Moskha, the port whence
it was shipped for Kanê and India (<a href="#para_32">32</a>) and Indo-Skythia
(<a href="#para_39">39</a>).</p>

<p>Regarding this important product Yule thus
writes:—“The coast of Hadhramaut is the true
and ancient Χώρα λιβανοφόρος or λιβανωτοφόρος,
indicated or described under those names by Theophrastus,
Ptolemy, Pliny, Pseudo-Arrian, and
other classical writers, <i>i.e.</i> the country producing
the fragrant gum-resin called by the Hebrews <i>Lebonah</i>,
by the Arabs <i>Luban</i> and <i>Kundur</i>, by the Greeks
<i>Libanos</i>, by the Romans <i>Thus</i>, in mediæval Latin
<i>Olibanum</i> (probably the Arabic <i>al-luban</i>, but popularly
interpreted as <i>oleum Libani</i>), and in English
frankincense, <i>i.e</i>, I apprehend, ‘genuine incense’
or ‘incense proper.’<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It is still produced in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
region and exported from it, but the larger part of
that which enters the markets of the world is
exported from the roadsteads of the opposite
Sumâlî coast. Frankincense when it first exudes
is milky white; whence the name <i>white incense</i> by
which Polo speaks of it, and the Arabic name
<i>luban</i> apparently refers to milk. The elder Niebuhr,
who travelled in Arabia, depreciated the Libanos
of Arabia, representing it as greatly inferior to that
brought from India, called Benzoin. He adds that
the plant which produces it is not native, but
originally from Abyssinia.”—<i>Marco Polo</i>, vol. II.
p. 443, &amp;c.</p>

<p>20. Λύκιον—Lycium. Exported from Barbarikon
in Indo-Skythia (<a href="#para_39">39</a>), and from Barugaza (<a href="#para_49">49</a>).
Lycium is a thorny plant, so called from being
found in Lykia principally. Its juice was used for
dying yellow, and a liquor drawn from it was
used as a medicine (Celsus v. 26, 30, and vi. 7).
It was held in great esteem by the ancients. Pliny
(xxiv. 77) says that a superior kind of Lycium
produced in India was made from a thorn called
also <i>Pyxacanthus</i> (box-thorn) <i>Chironia</i>. It is known
in India as <i>Ruzot</i>, an extract of the <i>Berberis
lycium</i> and <i>B. aristata</i>, both grown on the Himâlayas.

<p>21. Μάγλα—Magla—a kind of cassia mentioned
only in the <i>Periplûs</i>. Exported from Tabai (<a href="#para_12">12</a>).</p>

<p>22. Μάκειρ—Macer. Exported from Malaô and
Moundou (8, 9). According to Pliny, Dioskoridês,
and others, it is an Indian bark—perhaps a kind of
cassia. The bark is red and the root large. The
bark was used as a medicine in dysenteries. Pliny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
xii. 8; Salmasius, 1302. (? The <i>Karachâlâ</i> of the
bâzârs, <i>Kutajatvak</i>).</p>

<p>23. Μάλαβαθρον (Sans. <i>tamâlapattra</i>, the leaf
of the <i>Laurus Cassia</i>), Malabathrum, Betel. Obtained
by the Thînai from the Sesatai and exported to
India<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> (<a href="#para_65">65</a>); conveyed down the Ganges to Gangê
near its mouth (<a href="#para_63">63</a>); conveyed from the interior
of India to Mouziris and Nelkunda for export (<a href="#para_56">56</a>).
That Malabathrum was not only a masticatory, but
also an unguent or perfume, may be inferred from
Horace (<i>Odes</i>, II. vii. 89):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">... “coronatus nitentes</div>
  <div class="verse">Malabathro Syrio capillos”,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and from Pliny (xii. 59): “Dat et Malabathrum
Syria, arborum folio convoluto, arido colore, ex
quo exprimitur oleum ad unguenta: fertiliore
ejusdem Egypto: laudatius tamen ex India venit.”
From Ptolemy (VII. ii. 16) we learn that the best
Malabathrum was produced in Kirrhadia—that is,
Rangpur. Dioskoridês speaks of it as a masticatory,
and was aware of the confusion caused by
mistaking the nard for the betel.</p>

<p>21. Μέλι τὸ καλάμινον, τὸ λεγομενον σάκχαρ
(Sans. <i>śarkarâ</i>, Prâkṛit <i>sâkara</i>, Arab. <i>sukkar</i>,
Latin <i>saccharum</i>)—Honey from canes, called
Sugar. Exported from Barugaza to the marts
of Barbaria (<a href="#para_14">14</a>). The first Western writer
who mentions this article was Theophrastos, who
continued the labours of Aristotle in natural history.
He called it a sort of honey extracted from
reeds. Strabo states, on the authority of Nearkhos,
that reeds in India yield honey without bees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Ælian (<i>Hist. Anim.</i>) speaks of a kind of honey
pressed from reeds which grow among the Prasii.
Seneca (Epist. 84) speaks of sugar as a kind of honey
found in India on the leaves of reeds, which had
either been dropped on them from the sky as dew,
or had exuded from the reeds themselves. This
was a prevalent error in ancient times, <i>e.g.</i> Dioskoridês
says that sugar is a sort of concreted
honey found upon canes in India and Arabia Felix,
and Pliny that it is collected from canes like a gum.
He describes it as white and brittle between the
teeth, of the size of a hazel-nut at most, and used
in medicine only. So also Lucan, alluding to the
Indians near the Ganges, says that they quaff
sweet juices from tender reeds. Sugar, however,
as is well known, must be extracted by art from
the plant. It has been conjectured that the sugar
described by Pliny and Dioskoridês was sugar
candy obtained from China.</p>

<p>25. Μελίλωτον—Melilot, Honey-lotus. Exported
from Egypt to Barugaza (<a href="#para_49">49</a>). Melilot is the
Egyptian or Nymphæa Lotus, or Lily of the Nile,
the stalk of which contained a sweet nutritive
substance which was made into bread. So Vincent;
but Melilot is a kind of clover, so called from
the quantity of honey it contains. The nymphæa
lotus, or what was called the Lily of the Nile, is
not a true lotus, and contains no edible substance.</p>

<p>26. Μοκρότον. Exported from Moundou (<a href="#para_9">9</a>) and
Mossulon (<a href="#para_10">10</a>). It is a sort of incense, mentioned
only in the <i>Periplûs</i>.</p>

<p>27. Μότω—Motô—a sort of cassia exported from
Tabai and Opônê (<a href="#para_13">13</a>).</p>

<p>28. Μύρον—Myrrh. (Sans. <i>bola</i>.) Exported from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Egypt to Barugaza as a present for the king (<a href="#para_49">49</a>).
It is a gum or resin issuing from a thorn found
in Arabia Felix, Abyssinia, &amp;c., <i>vide</i> σμύρνη <i>inf.</i></p>

<p>29. Νάρδος (Sans. <i>nalada</i>, ‘kaskas,’ Heb. <i>nerd</i>)
Nard, Spikenard.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Gangetic spikenard brought
down the Ganges to Gangê, near its mouth (<a href="#para_63">63</a>), and
forwarded thence to Mouziris and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>).
Spikenard produced in the regions of the Upper
Indus and in Indo-Skythia forwarded through
Ozênê to Barugaza (<a href="#para_48">48</a>). Imported by the Egyptians
from Barugaza and Barbarikon in Indo-Skythia
(49, 39).</p>

<p>The <i>Nardos</i> is a plant called (from its root
being shaped like an ear of corn) νάρδου στάχυς,
also ναρδόσταχυς, Latin <i>Spica nardi</i>, whence ‘spikenard.’
It belongs to the species <i>Valeriana</i>. “No
Oriental aromatic,” says Vincent, “has caused
greater disputes among the critics or writers on
natural history, and it is only within these few
years that we have arrived at the true knowledge
of this curious odour by means of the inquiries
of Sir W. Jones and Dr. Roxburgh. Pliny describes
the nard with its <i>spica</i>, mentioning also
that both the leaves and the <i>spica</i> are of high
value, and that the odour is the prime in all
unguents; the price 100 denarii for a pound. But
he afterwards visibly confounds it with the Malabathrum
or Betel, as will appear from his usage
of <i>Hadrosphærum</i>, <i>Mesosphærum</i>, and <i>Microsphærum</i>,
terms peculiar to the Betel”—II. 743-4. See
Sir W. Jones on the spikenard of the ancients in
As. Res. vol. II. pp. 416 <i>et seq.</i>, and Roxburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>h’s
additional remarks on the spikenard of the ancients,
vol. IV. pp. 97 <i>et seq.</i>, and botanical observations
on the spikenard, pp. 433. See also Lassen,
<i>Ind. Alt.</i> vol. I. pp. 288 <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>30. Ναύπλιος—Nauplius. Exported in small
quantity from the marts of Azania (<a href="#para_17">17</a>). The
signification of the word is obscure, and the reading
suspected. For ΝαΥΠλιος Müller suggests
ΝαΡΓΙλιος, the Indian cocoanut, which the Arabians
call <i>Nargil</i> (Sansk. <i>nârikêla</i> or <i>nâlikêra</i>, Guj.
<i>nâliyêr</i>, Hindi <i>nâliyar</i>). It favours this suggestion
that cocoanut oil is a product of Zangibar, and
that in four different passages of Kosmas Indikopleustês
nuts are called αργελλια, which is either a
corrupt reading for ναργελλια, or Kosmas may not
have known the name accurately enough.</p>

<p>31. Ὀθόνιον—Muslin. Sêric muslin sent from
the Thînai to Barugaza and Dimurikê (<a href="#para_64">64</a>). Coarse
cottons produced in great quantity in Ariakê,
carried down from Ozênê to Barugaza (<a href="#para_48">48</a>); large
supplies sent thither from Tagara also (<a href="#para_51">51</a>);
Indian muslins exported from the markets of
Dimurikê to Egypt (<a href="#para_56">56</a>). Muslins of every description,
Seric and dyed of a mallow colour, exported
from Barugaza to Egypt (<a href="#para_49">49</a>); Indian muslin
taken to the island of Dioskoridês (<a href="#para_31">31</a>); wide Indian
muslins called μοναχὴ, <i>monâkhê</i>, i. e. of the best
and finest sort; and another sort called σαγματογήνη,
<i>sagmatogênê</i>, i. e. coarse cotton unfit for
spinning, and used for stuffing beds, cushions, &amp;c.,
exported from Barugaza to the Barbarine markets
(<a href="#para_14">14</a>), and to Arabia, whence it was exported to
Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>). The meanings given to <i>monâkhê</i> and
<i>sagmatogênê</i> (for which other readings have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
been suggested) are conjectural. Vincent defends
the meaning assigned to <i>sagmatogênê</i> by a quotation
from a passage in Strabo citing Nearkhos:—“Fine
muslins are made of cotton, but the
Makedonians use cotton for flocks, and stuffing
of couches.”</p>

<p>32. Ὀῖνος—Wine. Laodikean and Italian wine
exported in small quantity to Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>); to Aualitês
(<a href="#para_7">7</a>), Malaê (<a href="#para_8">8</a>), Mouza (<a href="#para_24">24</a>), Kanê (<a href="#para_28">28</a>), Barbarikon
in Indo-Skythia (<a href="#para_39">39</a>); the same sorts,
together with Arabian wine, to Barugaza (<a href="#para_49">49</a>);
sent in small quantity to Mouziris and Nelkunda
(<a href="#para_56">56</a>); the region inland from Oraia bears the vine
(<a href="#para_37">37</a>), which is found also in the district of Mouza
(<a href="#para_24">24</a>), whence wine is exported to the marts of
Azania, not for sale, but to gain the good will of
the natives (<a href="#para_17">17</a>). Wine is exported also from
the marts of Apologos and Omana to Barugaza
(<a href="#para_36">36</a>). By Arabian wine may perhaps be meant
palm or toddy wine, a great article of commerce.</p>

<p>33. Ὄμφακος Διοσπολιτικῆς χυλός—the juice of
the sour grape of Diospolis. Exported from
Egypt to Aualitês (<a href="#para_7">7</a>). This, says Vincent, was
the dipse of the Orientals, and still used as a
relish all over the East. <i>Dipse</i> is the rob of
grapes in their unripe state, and a pleasant acid.—II.
751. This juice is called by Dioskoridês (iv. 7)
in one word Ομφάκιον, and also (v. 12) Ὀῖνος Ὀμφακίτης.
Cf. Plin. xii. 27.</p>

<p>34. Ὄρυζα (Sansk. <i>vrîhi</i>)—Rice. Produced in
Oraia and Ariakê (37, 41), exported from Barugaza
to the Barbarine markets (<a href="#para_14">14</a>), and to the
island of Dioskoridês (<a href="#para_31">31</a>).</p>

<p>35. Πέπερι (Sansk. <i>pippalî</i>,) long pepper—Pep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>per.
Kottonarik pepper exported in large quantities
from Mouziris and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>); long
pepper from Barugaza (<a href="#para_49">49</a>). <i>Kottonara</i> was the
name of the district, and <i>Kottonarikon</i> the name
of the pepper for which the district was famous.
Dr. Buchanan identifies Kottonara with Kadattanâḍu,
a district in the Calicut country celebrated
for its pepper. Dr. Burnell, however, identifies
it with Kolatta-Nâḍu, the district about Tellicherry,
which, he says, is the pepper district.</p>

<p>36. Πυρὸς—Wheat. Exported in small quantity
from Egypt to Kanê (<a href="#para_28">28</a>), some grown in the district
around Mouza (<a href="#para_24">24</a>).</p>

<p>37. Σάκχαρι—Sugar: see under Μελι.</p>

<p>38. Σανδαράκη—Sandarakê (<i>chandrasa</i> of the
bazars); a resin from the <i>Thuja articulata</i> or
<i>Callitris quadrivalvis</i>, a small coniferous tree of
North Africa; it is of a faint aromatic smell
and is used as incense. Exported from Egypt to
Barugaza (<a href="#para_49">49</a>); conveyed to Mouziris and Nelkunda
(<a href="#para_56">56</a>).<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Sandarakê also is a red pigment—red sulphuret
of arsenic, as orpiment is the yellow sulphuret.
Cf. Plin. xxxv. 22, Hard. “Juba informs us that
sandarace and ochre are found in an island of the
Red Sea, Topazas, whence they are brought to
us.”</p>

<p>39. Σαντάλινα and σασάμινα ξύλα—Logs of Sandal
and Sasame (<i>santalum album</i>). Exported from
Barugaza to the marts of Omana and Apologos
(<a href="#para_30">30</a>). Σαντάλινα is a correction of the MS. reading
τρόχιος proposed by Salmasius. Kosmas Indiko<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>pleustes
calls sandalwood τζαδάνα. For σασαμινα
of the MS. Stuckius proposed σησάμινα—a futile,
emendation, since sesame is known only as a
leguminous plant from which an oil is expressed,
and not as a tree. But possibly Red Saunders
wood (<i>Pterocarpus Santalinus</i>) may be meant.</p>

<p>40. Σησάμινον ἔλαιον. See Ελαιον.</p>

<p>41. Σινδόνες διαφορώταται αἱ Γαγγητικᾶι. The finest
Bengal muslins exported from the Ganges (<a href="#para_63">63</a>);
other muslins in Taprobanê (<a href="#para_61">61</a>); Μαργαριτιδες (?),
made at Argalou and thence exported (59);
muslins of all sorts and mallow-tinted (μολοχιναι)
sent from Ozênê to Barugaza (<a href="#para_48">48</a>), exported thence
to Arabia for the supply of the market at Adouli
(<a href="#para_6">6</a>).</p>

<p>42. Σῖτος—Corn. Exported from Egypt to
Adouli (<a href="#para_7">7</a>), Malaô (<a href="#para_8">8</a>); a little to Mouza (<a href="#para_24">24</a>), and to
Kanê (<a href="#para_28">28</a>), and to Muziris and Nelkunda for ships’
stores (<a href="#para_56">56</a>); exported from Dimurikê and Ariakê
into the Barbarine markets (<a href="#para_14">14</a>), into Moskha (<a href="#para_32">32</a>)
and the island of Dioskoridês (<a href="#para_31">31</a>); exported also
from Mouza to the ports of Azania for presents (<a href="#para_17">17</a>).</p>

<p>43. Σμύρνη—Myrrh (vide μυρον). Exported from
Malaô, Moundou, Mossulon (8, 9, 10); from Aualitês
a small quantity of the best quality (<a href="#para_7">7</a>); a choice
sort that trickles in drops, called <i>Abeirminaia</i>
(ἐκλεκτὴ καὶ στακτὴ ἁβειρμιναία), exported from Mouza
(<a href="#para_24">24</a>). For Ἁβειρμιναία of the MS. Müller suggests
to read γαβειρμιναία, inclining to think that two
kinds of myrrh are indicated, the names of which
have been erroneously combined into one, viz. the
Gabiræan and Minæan, which are mentioned by
Dioskoridês, Hippokratês, and Galen. There is a
<i>Wadi Gabir</i> in Oman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>44. Στύραξ—Storax (Sans. <i>turuska</i>, <i>selarasa</i> of
the bazars),—one of the balsams. Exported from
Egypt to Kanê (<a href="#para_28">28</a>), Barbarikon on the Indus
(<a href="#para_39">39</a>), Barugaza (<a href="#para_40">40</a>). Storax is the produce of
the tree <i>Liquidambar orientale</i>, which grows in the
south of Europe and the Levant.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The purest
kind is storax in grains. Another kind is called
<i>styrax calamita</i>, from being brought in masses
wrapped up in the leaves of a certain reed. Another
kind, that sold in shops, is semi-fluid.</p>

<p>45. Φοῖνιξ—the Palm or Dates. Exported from
the marts of Apologos and Omana to Barugaza
(36, 37).</p>


<p>IV.—Metals and Metallic Articles:—</p>

<p>1. Ἀργυρᾶ σκεύη, ἀργυρώματα—Vessels of silver.
Exported from Egypt to Mossulon (<a href="#para_10">10</a>), to Barbarikon
on the Indus (<a href="#para_39">39</a>). Silver plate chased or
polished (τορνευτα or τετορνευμενα) sent as presents
to the despot of Mouza (<a href="#para_24">24</a>), to Kanê for the king
(<a href="#para_28">28</a>). Costly (βαρυτιμα) plate to Barugaza for the
king (<a href="#para_49">49</a>). Plate made according to the Egyptian
fashion to Adouli for the king (<a href="#para_6">6</a>).</p>

<p>2. Ἀρσενικὸν—Arsenic (<i>somal</i>). Exported from
Egypt to Mouziris and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>).</p>

<p>3. Δηνάριον—Denary. Exported in small quantity
from Egypt to Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>). Gold and silver
denarii sent in small quantity to the marts of
Barbaria (8, 13); exchanges with advantage for
native money at Barugaza (<a href="#para_49">49</a>).</p>

<p>The <i>denary</i> was a Roman coin equal to about 8½<i>d.</i>,
and a little inferior in value to the Greek drachma.</p>

<p>4. Κάλτις—Kaltis. A gold coin (νομισμα) cur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>rent
in the district of the Lower Ganges (<a href="#para_63">63</a>);
Benfey thinks the word is connected with the
Sanskrit <i>kalita</i>, i.e. <i>numeratum</i>.</p>

<p>5. Κασσίτερος (Sans. <i>baṅga</i>, <i>kathila</i>)—Tin.
Exported from Egypt to Aualitês (<a href="#para_7">7</a>), Malaô (<a href="#para_8">8</a>),
Kanê (<a href="#para_28">28</a>), Barugaza (<a href="#para_49">49</a>), Mouziris and Nelkunda
(<a href="#para_56">56</a>). India produced this metal, but not in those
parts to which the Egyptian trade carried it.</p>

<p>6. Μόλυβδος—Lead (Sansk. <i>nâga</i>, Guj. <i>sîsuṅ</i>).
Exported from Egypt to Barugaza, Muziris, and
Nelkunda (49, 56).</p>

<p>7. Ὀρείχαλκος—Orichalcum (Sans. <i>tripus</i>, Prak.
<i>pîtala</i>)—Brass. Used for ornaments and cut into
small pieces by way of coin. Exported from Egypt
to Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>).</p>

<p>The word means ‘mountain copper.’ Ramusio
calls it white copper from which the gold and
silver have not been well separated in extracting
it from the ore. Gold, it may be remarked, does
not occur as an export from any of the African
marts, throughout the <i>Periplûs</i>.</p>

<p>8. Σίδηρος, σιδηρύ σκεύη—Iron, iron utensils.
Exported from Egypt to Malaô, Moundou, Tabai,
Opônê (8, 9, 12, 13). Iron spears, swords and
adzes exported to Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>). Indian iron and
sword-blades (στομωμα) exported to Adouli from
Arabia (Ariakê?). Spears (λόγχαι) manufactured
at Mouza, hatchets (πελύκια), swords (μάχαιραι),
awls (ὀπέτια) exported from Mouza to Azania
(<a href="#para_17">17</a>).</p>

<p>On the Indian sword see Ktêsias, p. 80, 4.
The Arabian poets celebrate swords made of Indian
steel. Cf. Plin. xxxiv. 41:—“Ex omnibus autem
generibus palma Serico ferro est.” This iron, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
has already been stated, was sent to India along
with skins and cloth. Cf. also Edrisi, vol. I.
p. 65, ed. Joubert. Indian iron is mentioned in
the Pandects as an article of commerce.</p>

<p>9. Στίμμι—Stibium (Sans. <i>sauvîrânjana</i>, Prâk.
<i>surmâ</i>). Exported from Egypt to Barugaza (<a href="#para_49">49</a>),
to Mouziris and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>).</p>

<p>Stibium is a sulphuret of antimony, a dark pigment,
called <i>kohol</i>, much used in the East for
dyeing the eyelids.</p>

<p>10. Χαλκὸς—Copper (Sans. <i>tâmra</i>) or Brass.
Exported from Egypt to Kanê (<a href="#para_28">28</a>), to Barugaza
(<a href="#para_49">49</a>), Mouziris and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>). Vessels made
thereof (Χαλκουργήματα) sent to Mouza as presents
to the despot (<a href="#para_24">24</a>). Drinking-vessels (ποτηρια)
exported to the marts of Barbaria (8, 13). Big and
round drinking-cups to Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>). A few (μελίεφθα ὀλίγα)
to Malaô (<a href="#para_8">8</a>); μελίεφθα χαλκᾶ for cooking with,
and being cut into bracelets and anklets for women
to Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>).</p>

<p>Regarding μελίεφθα Vincent says: “No usage
of the word occurs elsewhere; but metals were
prepared with several materials to give them
colour, or to make them tractable, or malleable.
Thus χολόβαφα in Hesychius was brass prepared
with ox’s gall to give it the colour of gold, and
used, like our tinsel ornaments or foil, for stage
dresses and decorations. Thus common brass was
neither ductile nor malleable, but the Cyprian
brass was both. And thus perhaps brass, μελίεφθα
was formed with some preparation of honey.”
Müller cannot accept this view. “It is evident,”
he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> “that the reference is to ductile copper
from which, as Pliny says, all impurity has been
carefully removed by smelting, so that pots, bracelets,
and articles of that sort could be fabricated
from it. One might therefore think that the reading
should be περίεφθα or πυρίεφθα, but in such a
case the writer would have said περίεφθον χαλκόν.
In vulgar speech μελίεφθα is used as
a substantive noun, and I am therefore almost
persuaded that, just as molten copper, ὁ χαλκὸς
ὁ χυτὸς, <i>cuprum caldarium</i>, was called τρόχιος, from
the likeness in shape of its round masses to
hoops, so <i>laminæ</i> of ductile copper (<i>plaques de
cuivre</i>) might have been called μελίεφθα, because
shaped like thin honey-cakes, πεμματα μελίεφθα.”</p>

<p>11. Χρυσὸς—Gold. Exported from the marts of
Apologos and Omana to Barugaza (<a href="#para_36">36</a>). Gold
plate—χρυσώματα—exported from Egypt to Mouza
for the despot (<a href="#para_24">24</a>), and to Adouli for the king (<a href="#para_6">6</a>).</p>


<p>V. Stones:—</p>

<p>1. Λιθία διαφανὴς—Gems (carbuncles?) found in
Taprobanê (<a href="#para_63">63</a>); exported in every variety from
Mouziris and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>).</p>

<p>2. Αδάμας—Diamonds. (Sans. <i>vajra</i>, <i>pîraka</i>).
Exported from Mouziris and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>).</p>

<p>3. Καλλεανὸς λίθος—Gold-stone, yellow crystal,
chrysolith? Exported from Barbarikon in Indo-Skythia
(<a href="#para_39">39</a>).</p>

<p>It is not a settled point what stone is meant.
Lassen says that the Sanskrit word <i>kalyâṇa</i> means
<i>gold</i>, and would therefore identify it with the
chrysolith or gold-stone. If this view be correct,
the reading of the MS. need not be altered into
καλλαῖνὸς, as Salmasius, whom the editors of the
<i>Periplûs</i> generally follow, enjoins. In support of
the alteration Salmasius adduces Pliny, xxxvii.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
56:—“Callais sapphirum imitatur, candidior et
litoroso mari similis. Callainas vocant e turbido
Callaino”, and other passages. Schwanbeck, however,
maintaining the correctness of the MS.
reading, says that the Sanskrit word <i>kalyâṇa</i>
generally signifies <i>money</i>, but in a more general
sense <i>anything beautiful</i>, and might therefore have
been applied to this gem. <i>Kalyâṇa</i>, he adds, would
appear in Greek as καλλιανὸς or καλλεανὸς rather
than καλλαῖνὸς. In like manner <i>kalyâṇî</i> of the
Indians appears in our author not as καλλάïνα, but,
as it ought to be, καλλίενα.</p>

<p>4. Λύγδος—Alabaster. Exported from Mouza
(<a href="#para_24">24</a>). Salmasius says that an imitation of this
alabaster was formed of Parian marble, but that
the best and original <i>lygdus</i> was brought from
Arabia, that is, Mouza, as noted in the <i>Periplûs</i>.
Cf. Pliny (xxxvi. 8):—“Lygdinos in Tauro repertos
... antea ex Arabia tantum advehi solitos
enndoris eximii.”</p>

<p>5. Ὀνυχινὴ λίθια—Onyx (<i>akika</i>—agate). Sent in
vast quantities (πλειστη) from Ozênê and Paithana
to Barugaza (48, 51), and thence exported to
Egypt (<a href="#para_49">49</a>). Regarding the onyx mines of Gujarât
<i>vide</i> Ritter, vol. VI. p. 603.</p>

<p>6. Μουρρίνη, sup. λιθια—Fluor-spath. Sent from Ozênê to Barugaza, and
exported to Egypt (<a href="#para_49">49</a>). Porcelain made at Diospolis (μουρῥίνη λιθία ἡ
γενομένη ἐν Διοσπόλει) exported from Egypt to Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>).</p>

<p>The reading of the MS. is μοῤῥίνης. By this
is to be understood <i>vitrum murrhinum</i>, a sort of
china or porcelain made in imitation of cups or
vases of <i>murrha</i>, a precious fossil-stone resembling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
if not identical with, <i>fluor-spath</i>, such as is found in
Derbyshire. Vessels of this stone were exported
from India, and also, as we learn from Pliny, from
Karmania, to the Roman market, where they fetched
extravagant prices.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The “cups baked in Parthian
fires” (<i>pocula Parthis focis cocta</i>) mentioned by
Propertius (IV. v. 26) must be referred to the
former class. The whole subject is one which
has much exercised the pens of the learned. “Six
hundred writers,” says Müller, “emulously applying
themselves to explain what had the best claim
to be considered the <i>murrha</i> of the ancients, have
advanced the most conflicting opinions. Now it is
pretty well settled that the murrhine vases were
made of that stone which is called in German
<i>flusspath</i> (<i>spato-fluore</i>)”. He then refers to the
following as the principal authorities on the
subject:—Pliny—xxxiii. 7 <i>et seq.</i>; xxxiii. <i>proœm.</i>
Suetonius—<i>Oct.</i> c. 71; Seneca—<i>Epist.</i> 123;
Martial—iv. 86; xiv. 43; <i>Digest</i>—xxxiii. 10, 3;
xxxiv. 2. 19; Rozière—<i>Mémoire sur les Vases murrhins</i>,
&amp;c.; in <i>Description de l’Égypt</i>, vol. VI. pp.
277 <i>et seq.</i>: Corsi—<i>Delle Pietre antiche</i>, p. 106;
Thiersch—<i>Ueber die Vasa Murrhina der Alten, in
Abhandl. d. Munchn. Akad.</i> 1835, vol. I. pp. 443-509;
A learned Englishman in the <i>Classical Journal</i> for
1810, p. 472; Witzsch in Pauly’s <i>Real Encycl.</i>
vol. V. p. 253. See also Vincent, vol. II. pp. 723-7.</p>

<p>7. Ὀψιανὸς λίθος—the Opsian or Obsidian stone,
found in the Bay of Hanfelah (<a href="#para_5">5</a>). Pliny says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>—“The
opsians or obsidians are also reckoned as a
sort of glass bearing the likeness of the stone
which Obsius (or Obsidius) found in Ethiopia, of
a very black colour, sometimes even translucent,
hazier than ordinary glass to look through, and
when used for mirrors on the walls reflecting
but shadows instead of distinct images.” (Bk.
xxxvi. 37). The only Obsius mentioned in history
is a M. Obsius who had been Prætor, a friend of
Germanicus, referred to by Tacitus (<i>Ann.</i> IV. 68,
71). He had perhaps been for a time prefect of
Egypt, and had coasted the shore of Ethiopia at
the time when Germanicus traversed Egypt till
he came to the confines of Ethiopia. Perhaps,
however, the name of the substance is of Greek
origin—ὀψιανὀς, from its reflecting power.</p>

<p>8. Σάπφειρος—the Sapphire. Exported from
Barbarikon in Indo-Skythia (<a href="#para_39">39</a>). “The ancients
distinguished two sorts of dark blue or purple,
one of which was spotted with gold. Pliny says it
is never pellucid, which seems to make it a
different stone from what is now called sapphire.”—Vincent
(vol. II. p. 757), who adds in a note, “Dr.
Burgess has specimens of both sorts, the one with
gold spots like lapis lazuli, and not transparent.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>9. Ὑάκινθος—Hyacinth or Jacinth. Exported
from Mouziris and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>). According to
Salmasius this is the Ruby. In Solinus xxx.
it would seem to be the Amethyst (Sansk.
<i>pushkarâja</i>.)</p>

<p>10. Ὑαλος ἀργὴ—Glass of a coarse kind. Exported
from Egypt to Barugaza (<a href="#para_49">49</a>), to Mouziris
and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>). Vessels of glass (ὑαλα σκευη) ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>ported
from Egypt to Barbarikon in Indo-Skythia
(<a href="#para_39">39</a>). Crystal of many sorts (λιθίας ὑαλῆς πλεῖστα
γενη) exported from Egypt to Adouli, Aualitês,
Mossulon (6, 7, 10); from Mouza to Azania (<a href="#para_17">17</a>).</p>

<p>11. Χρυσόλιθος—Chrysolite. Exported from
Egypt to Barbarikon in Indo-Skythia (<a href="#para_39">39</a>), to
Barugaza (<a href="#para_43">43</a>), to Mouziris and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>).
Some take this to be the topaz (Hind. <i>pîrojâ</i>).</p>


<p>VI. Wearing Apparel:—</p>

<p>1. Ἱμάτια ἄγναφα—Cloths undressed. Manufactured
in Egypt and thence exported to Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>).
These were disposed of to the tribes of Barbaria—the
Troglodyte shepherds of Upper Egypt,
Nubia and Ethiopia.</p>

<p>2. Ἱμάτια βαρβαρικὰ σύμμικτα γεγναμμένα—Cloths
for the Barbarine markets, dressed and
dyed of various colours. Exported to Malaô and
Aualitês (8, 7).</p>

<p>3. Ἱματισμὸς Ἀραβικὸς—Cloth or coating for the
Arabian markets. Exported from Egypt (<a href="#para_24">24</a>).
Different kinds are enumerated:—Χειριδωτὸς, with
sleeves reaching to the wrist; Ὁτε ἁπλοῦς καὶ ὁ
κοινὸς, with single texture and of the common sort;
σκοτουλάτος, wrought with figures, checkered; the
word is a transliteration of the Latin <i>scutulatus</i>,
from <i>scutum</i>, the checks being lozenge-shaped, like
a shield: see Juvenal, Sat. ii. 79; διάχρυσος, shot
with gold; πολυτελὴς, a kind of great price sent
to the despot of Mouza; Κοινὸς καὶ ἁπλοῦς καὶ
ὁ νόθος, cloth of a common sort, and cloth of simple
texture, and cloth in imitation of a better commodity,
sent to Kanê (<a href="#para_28">28</a>); Διάφορος ἁπλους, of
superior quality and single texture, for the king
(<a href="#para_28">28</a>); Ἁπλοῦς, <i>of single texture</i>, in great quantity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
νόθος, in inferior sort imitating a better, in small
quantity, sent to Barbarikon in Indo-Skythia (<a href="#para_39">39</a>),
ἁπλοῦς καὶ νόθος παντοῖος, and for the king ἁπλοῦς
πολυτελης, sent to Barugaza (<a href="#para_49">49</a>); Ἱματισμὸς οὐ
πολύς—cloth in small quantity sent to Muziris
and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>); ἐντόπιος, of native manufacture,
exported from the marts of Apologos and
Omana to Barugaza (<a href="#para_36">36</a>).</p>

<p>4. Αβόλλαι—Riding or watch cloaks. Exported
from Egypt to Mouza (<a href="#para_34">34</a>), to Kanê (<a href="#para_28">28</a>).
This word is a transliteration of the Latin
<i>Abolla</i>. It is supposed, however, to be derived
from Greek: ἀμβολλη, i. e. ἀμφιβολὴ. It was a
woollen cloak of close texture—often mentioned
in the Roman writers: <i>e.g.</i> Juven. <i>Sat.</i> iii. 115
and iv. 70; Sueton. <i>Calig.</i> c. 35. Where the word
occurs in sec. 6 the reading of the MS. is ἅβολοι,
which Müller has corrected to ἀβόλλαι, though
Salmasius had defended the original reading.</p>

<p>5. Δικρόσσια (Lat. <i>Mantilia utrinque fimbriata</i>)—Cloths
with a double fringe. Exported from
Egypt to Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>). This word occurs only in the
<i>Periplûs</i>. The simple Κροσσιον, however, is met
with in Herodian, <i>Epim.</i> p. 72. An adjective
δίκροσσος is found in Pollux vii. 72. “We cannot
err much,” says Vincent, “in rendering the
δικρόσσια of the <i>Periplûs</i> either <i>cloth fringed</i>, with
Salmasius, or <i>striped</i>, with Apollonius. Meursius
says λεντία ἄκροσσα are <i>plain linens not striped</i>.”</p>

<p>6. Ζώναι πολύμιτοι πηχυαῖοι—Flowered or embroidered
girdles, a cubit broad. Exported from
Egypt to Barugaza (<a href="#para_49">49</a>). Σκιωταὶ—girdles (<i>kâcha</i>)
shaded of different colours, exported to Mouza (<a href="#para_24">24</a>).
This word occurs only in the <i>Periplûs</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>7. Καυνάκαὶ—Garments of frieze. Exported
from Arabia to Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>); a pure sort—ἁπλοι—exported
to the same mart from Egypt (<a href="#para_6">6</a>). In
the latter of these two passages the MS. reading
is γαυνάκαὶ. Both forms are in use: conf. Latin
<i>gaunace</i>—Varro, <i>de L. L.</i> 4, 35. It means also
<i>a fur garment</i> or <i>blanket</i>—<i>vestis stragula</i>.</p>

<p>8. Λώδικες—Quilts or coverlids. Exported in
small quantity from Egypt to Mouza (<a href="#para_24">24</a>) and
Kanê (<a href="#para_28">28</a>).</p>

<p>9. Περιζώματα—Sashes, girdles, or aprons.
Exported from Barugaza to Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>), and into
Barbaria (<a href="#para_14">14</a>).</p>

<p>10. Πολύμιτα—Stuffs in which several threads
were taken for the woof in order to weave flowers
or other objects: Latin <i>polymita</i> and <i>plumatica</i>.
Exported from Egypt to Barbarikon in Indo-Skythia
(<a href="#para_39">39</a>), to Mouziris and Nelkunda (<a href="#para_56">56</a>).</p>

<p>11. Σάγοι Ἀρσινοητικοὶ γεγναμμένοι καὶ βεβαμμένοι—Coarse
cloaks made at Arsinoê, dressed and
dyed. Exported from Egypt to Barbaria (8, 13).</p>

<p>12. Στολαὶ Ἀρσινοητικάι—Women’s robes made
at Arsinoê. Exported from Egypt to Adouli (<a href="#para_6">6</a>).</p>

<p>13. Χιτῶνες—Tunics. Exported from Egypt to
Malaô, Moundou, Mossulon (8, 9, 10).</p>


<p>VII. In addition to the above, works of art are
mentioned.</p>

<p>Ἀνδριάντες—Images, sent as presents to Kharibaël
(<a href="#para_48">48</a>). Cf. Strabo (p. 714), who among the
articles sent to Arabia enumerates τορευμα, γραφην,
πλασμα, pieces of sculpture, painting, statues.</p>

<p>Μουσικἀ—Instruments of music, for presents to
the king of Ariakê (<a href="#para_49">49</a>).</p>

<p><i>Commentary.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) <em class="gesperrt">Myos Hormos.</em>—Its situation is determined
by the cluster of islands now called
<em class="gesperrt">Jifâtîn</em> [lat. 27° 12´ N., long. 33°&nbsp;55´ E.] of
which the three largest lie opposite an indenture
of the coast of Egypt on the curve of which its
harbour was situated [near Ras Abu Somer, a
little north of Satâjah Island]. It was founded by
Ptolemy Philadelphos <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 274, who selected it as
the principal port of the Egyptian trade with
India in preference to Arsinoê,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> N. N. E. of Suez,
on account of the difficulty and tediousness of the
navigation down the Heroöpolite Gulf. The vessels
bound for Africa and the south of Arabia left its
harbour about the time of the autumnal equinox,
when the North West wind which then prevailed
carried them quickly down the Gulf. Those bound
for the Malabar Coast or Ceylon left in July, and
if they cleared the Red Sea before the 1st of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
September, they had the monsoon to assist their
passage across the ocean. <em class="gesperrt">Myos Hormos</em> was
distant from <em class="gesperrt">Koptos</em> [lat. 26° N.], the station on
the Nile through which it communicated with
Alexandria, a journey of seven or eight days along
a road opened through the desert by Philadelphos.
The name <em class="gesperrt">Myos Hormos</em> is of Greek origin, and
may signify either the Harbour of the Mouse, or,
more probably, of the Mussel, since the pearl mussel
abounded in its neighbourhood. <em class="gesperrt">Agatharkhidês</em>
calls it <em class="gesperrt">Aphroditēs Hormos</em>, and Pliny
<em class="gesperrt">Veneris Portus</em>. [Veneris Portus however
was probably at Sherm Sheikh, lat. 24°&nbsp;36´ N. Off
the coast is Wade Jemâl Island, lat. 24°&nbsp;39´ N.,
long. 35°&nbsp;8´ E., called Iambe by Pliny, and perhaps
the Aphroditês Island of Ptolemy IV. v. 77.]
Referring to this name Vincent says: “Here if
the reader will advert to Aphroditê, the Greek
title of Venus, as springing from the foam of
the ocean, it will immediately appear that the
Greeks were translating here, for the native term
to this day is <i>Suffange-el-Bahri</i>, ‘sponge of the
sea’; and the vulgar error of the sponge being the
foam of the sea, will immediately account for
Aphroditê.”</p>

<p>The rival of Myos-Hormos was <em class="gesperrt">Berenikê</em>, a
city built by Ptolemy Philadelphos, who so named
it in honour of his mother, who was the daughter
of Ptolemy Lagos and Antigonê. It was in the
same parallel with Syênê and therefore not far
from the Tropic [lat. 23°&nbsp;55´ N.]. It stood nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
at the bottom of <i>Foul Bay</i> (ἐν βάθει τοῦ Ἀκαθάρτου
so Κὀλπου), called from the coast being foul with
shoals and breakers, and not from the impurity of
its water, as its Latin name, <i>Sinus Immundus</i>, would
lead us to suppose. Its ruins are still perceptible
even to the arrangement of the streets,
and in the centre is a small Egyptian temple
adorned with hieroglyphics and bas-reliefs of
Greek workmanship. Opposite to the town is
a very fine natural harbour, the entrance of which
has been deep enough for small vessels, though
the bar is now impassable at low water. Its prosperity
under the Ptolemies and afterwards under
the Romans was owing to its safe anchorage and
its being, like Myos-Hormos, the terminus of a
great road from Koptos along which the traffic
of Alexandria with Ethiopia, Arabia, and India
passed to and fro. Its distance from <em class="gesperrt">Koptos</em>
was 258 Roman miles or 11 days’ journey. The
distance between Myos-Hormos and Berenikê is
given in the <i>Periplûs</i> at 225 miles, but this is
considerably above the mark. The difficulty of
the navigation may probably have made the
distance seem greater than it was in reality.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_2"></a>2. The country which adjoins them on the
right below Berenîkê is <em class="gesperrt">Barbaria</em>. Here the
sea-board is peopled by the <em class="gesperrt">Ikhthyophagoi</em>,
who live in scattered huts built in the narrow
gorges of the hills, and further inland are the
<em class="gesperrt">Berbers</em>, and beyond them the <em class="gesperrt">Agriophagoi</em>
and <em class="gesperrt">Moskhophagoi</em>, tribes under
regular government by kings. Beyond these
again, and still further inland towards the west
[is situated the metropolis called Meroê].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(2) Adjoining <em class="gesperrt">Berenikê</em> was <em class="gesperrt">Barbaria</em>
(ἡ Βαρβαρικὴ χώρα)—the land about Ras Abû
Fatima [lat. 22°&nbsp;26´ N.—Ptol. IV. vii. 28]. The
reading of the MS. is ἡ Τισηβαρικὴ which Müller
rejects because the name nowhere occurs in any
work, and because if <em class="gesperrt">Barbaria</em> is not mentioned
here, our author could not afterwards
(Section 5) say ἡ ἄλλη Βαρβαρία. The <em class="gesperrt">Agriophagoi</em>
who lived in the interior are mentioned
by Pliny (vi. 35), who says that they lived principally
on the flesh of panthers and lions. Vincent
writes as if instead of Αγριοφάγων the reading
should be Ακριδοφάγων locust-eaters, who are
mentioned by Agatharkhidês in his <i>De Mari
Erythraeo</i>, Section 58. Another inland tribe
is mentioned in connection with them—the <em class="gesperrt">Moskhophagoi</em>,
who may be identified with the
<em class="gesperrt">Rizophagoi</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Spermatophagoi</em> of
the same writer, who were so named because they
lived on roots of the tender suckers and buds
of trees, called in Greek μόσχοι. This being a
term applied also to the young of animals,
Vincent was led to think that this tribe fed on
the brinde or flesh cut out of the living animal as
described by Bruce.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_3"></a>3. Below the <em class="gesperrt">Moskhophagoi</em>, near the
sea, lies a little trading town distant from Berenîkê
about 4000 stadia, called <em class="gesperrt">Ptolemaïs
Thêrôn</em>, from which, in the days of the
Ptolemies, the hunters employed by them used
to go up into the interior to catch elephants. In
this mart is procured the true (or marine)
tortoise-shell, and the land kind also, which,
however, is scarce, of a white colour, and smaller
size. A little ivory is also sometimes obtainable,
resembling that of <em class="gesperrt">Adouli</em>. This place
has no port, and is approachable only by boats.</p>

viii. 1.; IV. vii. 7; VIII. xvi. 10]. It was originally
an Ethiopian village, but was extended
and fortified by Ptolemy Philadelphos, who made
it the depôt of the elephant trade, for which its
situation on the skirts of the great Nubian forest,
where these animals abounded, rendered it peculiarly
suitable. The Egyptians before this had
imported their elephants from Asia, but as the
supply was precarious, and the cost of importation
very great, Philadelphos made the most
tempting offers to the Ethiopian elephant-hunters
(Elephantophagoi) to induce them to abstain from
eating the animal, or to reserve at least a portion
of them for the royal stables. They rejected
however all his solicitations, declaring that even
for all Egypt they would not forego the luxury of
their repast. The king resolved thereupon to procure
his supplies by employing hunters of his own.</p>

<p><a id="para_4"></a>4. Leaving Ptolemaïs Thêrôn we are conducted,
at the distance of about 3000 stadia, to
<em class="gesperrt">Adouli</em>, a regular and established port of trade
situated on a deep bay the direction of which is
due south. Facing this, at a distance seaward
of about 200 stadia from the inmost recess of
the bay, lies an island called <em class="gesperrt">Oreinê</em> (or ‘the
mountainous’), which runs on either side parallel
with the mainland. Ships, that come to trade
with Adouli, now-a-days anchor here, to avoid
being attacked from the shore; for in former
times when they used to anchor at the very
head of the bay, beside an island called
<em class="gesperrt">Diodôros</em>, which was so close to land that the
sea was fordable, the neighbouring barbarians,
taking advantage of this, would run across to
attack the ships at their moorings. At the
distance of 20 stadia from the sea, opposite
<em class="gesperrt">Oreinê</em>, is the village of Adouli, which is not
of any great size, and inland from this a three
days’ journey is a city, <em class="gesperrt">Kolöê</em>, the first
market where ivory can be procured. From
Kolöê it takes a journey of five days to reach the
metropolis of the people called the <em class="gesperrt">Auxumitae</em>,
whereto is brought, through the province
called <em class="gesperrt">Kyêneion</em>, all the ivory obtained on
the other side of the Nile, before it is sent on to
Adouli. The whole mass, I may say, of the elephants
and rhinoceroses which are killed <i>to supply
the trade</i> frequent the uplands <i>of the interior</i>,
though at rare times they are seen near the coast,
even in the neighbourhood of Adouli. Besides
the islands already mentioned, a cluster consisting
of many small ones lies out in the sea to the
right of this port. They bear the name of
<em class="gesperrt">Alalaiou</em>, and yield the tortoises with which
the <em class="gesperrt">Ikhthyophagoi</em> supply the market.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(4) Beyond <em class="gesperrt">Ptolemaïs Thêrôn</em> occurs
<em class="gesperrt">Adoulê</em>, at a distance, according to the <i>Periplûs</i>,
of 3000 stadia—a somewhat excessive estimate.
The place is called also <em class="gesperrt">Adoulei</em> and more
commonly Adoulis by ancient writers (Ptol. IV.
vii. 8; VIII. xvi. 11). It is represented by the
modern Thulla or Zula [pronounced Azule,—lat.
15°&nbsp;12´-15°&nbsp;15´ N., long. 39°&nbsp;36´ E.].—To the West
of this, according to Lord Valentia and Mr. Salt,
there are to be found the remains of an ancient
city. It was situated on the <em class="gesperrt">Adoulikos
Kolpos</em> (Ptol. I. xv. 11.; IV. vii. 8), now called
Annesley Bay, the best entrance into Abyssinia.
It was erroneously placed by D’Anville at Dokhnau
or Harkiko, close to Musawwâ [lat. 15°&nbsp;35´ N.]
There is much probability in the supposition that
it was founded by a party of those Egyptians who,
as we learn from Herodotos (II. 30), to the number
of 240,000 fled from their country in the days of
Psammêtikḥos (<span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 671-617) and went to as great
a distance beyond Meroë, the capital of Ethiopia, as
Meroë is beyond Elephantinê. This is the account
which Pliny (VI. 3-4) gives of its foundation,
adding that it was the greatest emporium of the
<em class="gesperrt">Troglodytes</em>, and distant from <em class="gesperrt">Ptolemaïs</em>
a five days’ voyage, which by the ordinary reckoning
is 2,500 stadia. It was an emporium for
rhinoceros’ hides, ivory and tortoise-shell. It had
not only a large sea-borne traffic, but was also a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
caravan station for the traffic of the interior of
Africa. Under the Romans it was the haven
of <em class="gesperrt">Auxumê</em> (Ptol. IV. vii. 25,—written also
Auxumis, Axumis), now Axum, the capital of the
kingdom of Tigre in Abyssinia. <em class="gesperrt">Auxumê</em> was
the chief centre of the trade with the interior of
Africa in gold-dust, ivory, leather, hides and
aromatics. It was rising to great prosperity
and power about the time the <i>Periplûs</i> was
written, which is the earliest work extant in which
it is mentioned. It was probably founded by the
Egyptian exiles already referred to. Its remaining
monuments are perfectly Egyptian and not
pastoral, Troglodytik, Greek, or Arabian in their
character. Its name at the same time retains
traces of the term <em class="gesperrt">Asmak</em>, by which, as we
learn from Herodotos, those exiles were designated,
and Heeren considers it to have been one
of the numerous priest-colonies which were sent
out from Meroë.</p>

<p>At Adouli was a celebrated monument, a
throne of white marble with a slab of basanite
stone behind it, both covered with Greek characters,
which in the sixth century of our era were
copied by <em class="gesperrt">Kosmas Indikopleustês</em>. The
passage in Kosmos relating to this begins
thus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> “<em class="gesperrt">Adulê</em> is a city of Ethiopia and the
port of communication with <em class="gesperrt">Axiômis</em>, and the
whole nation of which that city is the capital.
In this port we carry on our trade from
Alexandria and the Elanitik Gulf. The town
itself is about a mile from the shore, and as you
enter it on the Western side which leads from
<em class="gesperrt">Axiômis</em>, there is still remaining a chair or
throne which appertained to one of the Ptolemys
who had subjected this country to his authority.”
The first portion of the inscription records that
Ptolemy Euergetês (247-222 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) received from
the Troglodyte Arabs and Ethiopians certain
elephants which his father, the second king of the
Makedonian dynasty, and himself had taken in
hunting in the region of <span class="smcap">Adulê</span> and trained to
war in their own kingdom. The second portion of
the inscription commemorates the conquests of an
anonymous Ethiopian king in Arabia and Ethiopia
as far as the frontier of Egypt. <em class="gesperrt">Adouli</em>, it is
known for certain, received its name from a tribe
so designated which formed a part of the <em class="gesperrt">Danakil</em>
shepherds who are still found in the neigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>bourhood
of Annesley Bay, in the island of Diset
[lat. 15°&nbsp;28´, long. 30°&nbsp;45´, the Diodôros perhaps
of the <i>Periplûs</i>] opposite which is the town or
station of Masawâ (anc. Saba) [lat. 15°&nbsp;37´ N.,
long. 39°&nbsp;28´ E.], and also in the archipelago of
<em class="gesperrt">Dhalak</em>, called in the <i>Periplûs</i>, the islands of
<em class="gesperrt">Alalaiou</em>. The merchants of Egypt, we learn
from the work, first traded at Masawwâ but afterwards
removed to Oreinê for security. This is an
islet in the south of the Bay of Masawwâ, lying
20 miles from the coast; it is a rock as its name
imports, and is of considerable elevation.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Aduli</em> being the best entrance into Abyssinia,
came prominently into notice during the late
Abyssinian war. Beke thus speaks of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> “In our
recent visit to Abyssinia I saw quite enough to
confirm the opinion I have so long entertained,
that when the ancient Greeks founded Adule or
Adulis at the mouth of the river Hadâs, now only
a river bed except during the rains, though a
short way above there is rain all the year round,
they knew that they possessed one of the keys of
Abyssinia.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_5"></a>5. Below Adouli, about 800 stadia, occurs
another very deep bay, at the entrance of which
on the right are vast accumulations of sand, wherein
is found deeply embedded the Opsian stone,
which is not obtainable anywhere else. The
king of all this country, from the <em class="gesperrt">Moskhophagoi</em>
to the other end of <em class="gesperrt">Barbaria</em>, is
<em class="gesperrt">Zôskalês</em>, a man at once of penurious
habits and of a grasping disposition, but otherwise
honourable in his dealings and instructed
in the Greek language.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(5) At a distance of about 100 miles beyond
<em class="gesperrt">Adouli</em> the coast is indented by another bay now
known as <em class="gesperrt">Hanfelah</em> bay [near Râs Hanfelah in
lat. 14°&nbsp;44´, long. 40°&nbsp;49´ E.] about 100 miles from
Annesley Bay and opposite an island called Daramsas
or Hanfelah. It has wells of good water and a small
lake of fresh water after the rains; the coast is inhabited
by the Dummoeta, a tribe of the Danakil.
This is the locality where, and where only, the Opsian
or Obsidian stone was to be found. Pliny calls it an
unknown bay, because traders making for the ports
of Arabia passed it by without deviating from
their course to enter it. He was aware, as well as
our author, that it contained the Opsian stone, of
which he gives an account, already produced in the
introduction.</p></blockquote>

<p>The articles locally produced for export are
ivory, tortoise-shell, and rhinoceros. Most of
the goods which supply the market arrive any
time from January to September—that is, from
Tybi to Thôth. The best season, however, for
ships from Egypt to put in here is about the
month of September.</p>

<p><a id="para_7"></a>7. From this bay the Arabian Gulf trends
eastward, and at <em class="gesperrt">Aualitês</em> is contracted to
its narrowest. At a distance of about 4000
stadia (<i>from Adouli</i>), if you still sail along the
same coast, you reach other marts of <em class="gesperrt">Barbaria</em>,
called the marts beyond (<i>the Straits</i>), which occur
in successive order, and which, though harbourless,
afford at certain seasons of the year good
and safe anchorage. The first district you come
to is that called <em class="gesperrt">Aualitês</em>, where the passage
across the strait to the opposite point of Arabia
is shortest. Here is a small port of trade,
called, like the district, <em class="gesperrt">Aualitês</em>, which
can be approached only by little boats and rafts.
The imports of this place are—</p>

<p>Ὑαλὴ λίθια σύμμικτος—Flint glass of various
sorts.</p>

<p>Χυλός] Διοσπολιτικῆς ὄμφακος—Juice of the sour

<p>The exports, which are sometimes conveyed
on rafts across the straits by the <em class="gesperrt">Berbers</em>
themselves to <em class="gesperrt">Okêlis</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Mouza</em> on the
opposite coast, are—</p>

<p>The barbarians forming the population of the

<blockquote>

<p>(6, 7) From this bay the coast of the gulf,
according to our author, has a more easterly
direction to the Straits, the distance to which
from Adouli is stated at 4,000 stadia, an estimate
much too liberal. In all this extent of coast the
<i>Periplûs</i> mentions only the bay of the Opsian-stones
and conducts us at once from thence to
Aualités at the straits. Strabo however, and
Juba, and Pliny, and Ptolemy mention several
places in this tract, such as <em class="gesperrt">Arsinoë</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Berenîkê</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
<em class="gesperrt">Epideirês</em>, the Grove of Eumenês,
the Chase of Puthangelos, the Territory of the
Elephantophagoi, &amp;c. The straits are called by
Ptolemy <em class="gesperrt">Deirê</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Dêrê</em> (<i>i. e.</i> the neck), a word
which from its resemblance in sound to the Latin
<i>Dirae</i> has sometimes been explained to mean
“the terrible.” (I. xv. 11; IV. vii. 9; VIII.
xvi. 12). “The <i>Periplûs</i>,” Vincent remarks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
“makes no mention of Deirê, but observes that
the point of contraction is close to <em class="gesperrt">Abalitês</em>
or the Abalitik mart; it is from this mart that
the coast of Africa falling down first to the South
and curving afterwards towards the East is styled
the Bay of <em class="gesperrt">Aualitês</em> by Ptolemy, (IV. vii.
10, 20, 27, 30, 39,) but in the <i>Periplûs</i> this name
is confined to a bay immediately beyond the
straits which D’Anville has likewise inserted in
his map, but which I did not fully understand
till I obtained Captain Cook’s chart and found it
perfectly consistent with the <i>Periplûs</i>.” It is the
gulf of Tejureh or Zeyla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>The tract of country extending from the Straits
to Cape Arômata (now Guardafui) is called
at the present day <em class="gesperrt">Adel</em>. It is described by
Strabo (XVI. iv. 14), who copies his account of it
from Artemidoros. He mentions no emporium,
nor any of the names which occur in the <i>Periplûs</i>
except the haven of Daphnous. [Bandar Mariyah,
lat. 11°&nbsp;46´ N., long. 50°&nbsp;38´ E.] He supplies
however many particulars regarding the region
which are left unnoticed by our author as having
no reference to commerce—particulars, however,
which prove that these parts which were resorted
to in the times of the Ptolemies for elephant-hunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>ing
were much better known to the ancients than
they were till quite recently known to ourselves.
Ptolemy gives nearly the same series of names
(IV. vii. 9, 10) as the <i>Periplûs</i>, but with some discrepancies
in the matter of their distances which
he does not so accurately state. His list is: <em class="gesperrt">Dêre</em>,
a city; <em class="gesperrt">Abalitês</em> or Aualitês, a mart; <em class="gesperrt">Malaô</em>,
a mart; <em class="gesperrt">Moundou</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Mondou</em>, a mart;
Mondou, an island; Mosulon, a cape and a mart;
<em class="gesperrt">Kobê</em>, a mart; <em class="gesperrt">Elephas</em>, a mountain; <em class="gesperrt">Akkanai</em>
or Akannai, a mart; <em class="gesperrt">Arômata</em>, a cape
and a mart.</p>

<p>The mart of <em class="gesperrt">Abalitês</em> is represented by the
modern <em class="gesperrt">Zeyla</em> [lat. 11°&nbsp;22´ N., long. 43°&nbsp;29´ E.,
79 miles from the straits.] On the N. shore of the
gulf are Abalit and Tejureh. Abalit is 43 miles
from the straits, and Tejureh 27 miles from
Abalit. This is the <em class="gesperrt">Zouileh</em> of Ebn Haukal
and the <em class="gesperrt">Zalegh</em> of Idrisi. According to the
<i>Periplûs</i> it was near the straits, but Ptolemy
has fixed it more correctly at the distance from
them of 50 or 60 miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_8"></a>8. Beyond Aualitês there is another mart,
superior to it, called <em class="gesperrt">Malaô</em>, at a distance
by sea of 800 stadia. The anchorage is an
open road, sheltered, however, by a cape protruding
eastward. The people are of a more peaceable
disposition than their neighbours. The
imports are such as have been already specified,
with the addition of—</p>

<p>Πλείονες χιτῶνες—Tunics in great quantity.</p>

<p>Σάγοι Ἀρσινοητικοι γεγναμμένοι καὶ βεβαμμένοι—Coarse
cloaks (or blankets) manufactured at Arsinoê,
prepared by the fuller and dyed.</p>

<p>Μελίεφθα ὀλίγα—A few utensils made of copper
fused with honey.</p>

<p>Σίδερος—Iron.</p>

<p>Δηνάριον οὐ πολὺ χρυσοῦντε καὶ ἀργυροῦν—Specie,—gold
and silver, but not much.</p>

<p>The exports from this locality are—</p>

<p>Σμύρνα—Myrrh.</p>

<p>Λίβανος ὁ περατικος ὀλίγὸς—Frankincense <i>which
we call peratic</i>, <i>i.e.</i> from beyond the straits, a little
only.</p>

<p>Κασσία σκληροτέρα—Cinnamon of a hard grain.</p>

<p>Δούακα—Douaka (<i>an inferior kind of cinnamon</i>).</p>

<p>Κάγκαμον—The gum (<i>for fumigation</i>) <i>kangkamon</i>.
‘Dekamalli,’ gum.</p>

<p>Μάκειρ—The spice <i>macer</i>, which is carried to
Arabia.</p>

<p>Σώματα σπανίως—Slaves, a few.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(8) <em class="gesperrt">Malaô</em> as a mart was much superior to
Abalitês, from which our author estimates its
distance to be 800 stadia, though it is in reality
greater. From the description he gives of its
situation it must be identified with Berbereh
[lat. 10°&nbsp;25´ N., long. 45°&nbsp;1´ E.] now the most
considerable mart on this part of the coast.
Vincent erroneously places it between Zeyla and
the straits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_9"></a>9. Distant from <em class="gesperrt">Malaô</em> two days’ sail is
the trading port of <em class="gesperrt">Moundou</em>, where ships
find a safer anchorage by mooring at an island
which lies very close to shore. The exports
and imports are similar to those of the preceding
marts, with the addition of the fragrant gum
called <i>Mokrotou</i>, a peculiar product of the place.
The native traders here are uncivilized in their
manners.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(9) The next mart after Malaô is <em class="gesperrt">Moundou</em>,
which, as we learn from Ptolemy, was also the
name of an adjacent island—that which is now
called Meyet or Burnt-island [lat. 11°&nbsp;12´ N.,
long. 47°&nbsp;17´ E., 10 miles east of Bandar Jedid].</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_10"></a>10. After <em class="gesperrt">Moundou</em>, if you sail eastward
as before for two or three days, there comes
next <em class="gesperrt">Mosullon</em>, where it is difficult to anchor.
It imports the same sorts of commodities as
have been already mentioned, and also utensils
of silver and others of iron but not so many,
and glass-ware. It exports a vast amount
of cinnamon (whence it is a port requiring
ships of heavy burden) and other fragrant
and aromatic products, besides tortoise-shell,
but in no great quantity, and the incense
called <i>mokrotou</i> inferior to that of Moundou, and
frankincense brought from parts further
distant, and ivory and myrrh though in small
quantity.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(10) At a distance beyond it of two or three
days’ sail occurs <em class="gesperrt">Mosulon</em>, which is the name
both of a mart and of a promontory. It is mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
by Pliny (VI. 34), who says: “Further on is the
bay of <em class="gesperrt">Abalitês</em>, the island of <em class="gesperrt">Diodôrus</em>
and other islands which are desert. On the mainland,
which has also deserts, occur a town <em class="gesperrt">Gaza</em>
[Bandar Gazim, long. 49°&nbsp;13´ E.], the promontory
and port of <em class="gesperrt">Mosylon</em>, whence cinnamon is
exported. Sesostris led his army to this point
and no further. Some writers place one town of
Ethiopia beyond it, Baricaza, which lies on the
coast. According to Juba the Atlantic Sea
begins at the promontory of Mossylon.” Juba
evidently confounded this promontory with Cape
Arômata, and Ptolemy, perhaps in consequence,
makes its projection more considerable than it is.
D’Anville and Gosselin thought <em class="gesperrt">Mossulon</em>
was situated near the promontory Mete, where
is a river, called the Soal, which they supposed
preserved traces of the name of Mossulon. This
position however cannot be reconciled with the
distances given in the <i>Periplûs</i>, which would lead
us to look for it where Guesele is placed in the
latest description given of this coast. Vincent on
very inadequate grounds would identify it with
Barbara or Berbera. [Müller places it at Bandar
Barthe and Ras Antarah, long. 49°&nbsp;35´ E.]</p>

past a place called <em class="gesperrt">Neiloptolemaios</em>, and
past <em class="gesperrt">Tapatêgê</em> and the Little Laurel-grove,
you are conducted in two days to Capo <em class="gesperrt">Elephant</em>.
Here is a stream called <em class="gesperrt">Elephant</em>
River, and the Great Laurel-grove called <em class="gesperrt">Akannai</em>,

<p>(11) After Mosulon occurs Cape Elephant,
at some distance beyond <em class="gesperrt">Neiloptolemaios</em>,
<em class="gesperrt">Tapatêgê</em>, and the Little Laurel-grove. At the
Cape is a river and the Great Laurel-grove called
<em class="gesperrt">Akannai</em>. Strabo in his account of this coast
mentions a Neilospotamia which however can
hardly be referred to this particular locality
which pertains to the region through which the
Khori or San Pedro flows, of which Idrisi (I. 45)
thus writes: “At two journeys’ distance from
Markah in the desert is a river which is subject
to risings like the Nile and on the banks of which
they sow dhorra.” Regarding Cape Elephant
Vincent says, “it is formed by a mountain conspicuous
in the Portuguese charts under the name
of Mount Felix or Felles from the native term
Jibel Fîl, literally, Mount Elephant. The cape
[Ras Filik, 800 ft. high, lat. 11°&nbsp;57´ N., long. 50°
37´ E.] is formed by the land jutting up to the
North from the direction of the coast which is
nearly East and West, and from its northernmost
point the land falls off again South-East to
Râs 'Asir—Cape Guardafui, the Arômata of the
ancients. We learn from Captain Saris, an English
navigator, that there is a river at Jibel Fîl.
In the year 1611 he stood into a bay or harbour
there which he represents as having a safe
entrance for three ships abreast: he adds also that
several sorts of gums very sweet in burning were
still purchased by the Indian ships from Cambay
which touched here for that purpose in their
passage to Mocha.” The passage in the <i>Periplûs</i>
where these places are mentioned is very corrupt.
Vincent, who regards the greater <em class="gesperrt">Daphnôn</em>
(Laurel-grove) as a river called <em class="gesperrt">Akannai</em>, says,
“Neither place or distance is assigned to any
of these names, but we may well allot the rivers
Daphnôn and Elephant to the synonymous town
and cape; and these may be represented by the
modern Mete and Santa Pedro.” [Müller places
Elephas at Ras el Fîl, long. 50°&nbsp;37´ E., and Akannai
at Ulûlah Bandar, long. 50°&nbsp;56´ E., but they
may be represented by Ras Ahileh, where a river
enters through a lagoon in 11°&nbsp;46´, and Bonah,
a town with wells of good water in lat. 11°&nbsp;58´ N.,
long. 50°&nbsp;51´ E.]</p>

<p><a id="para_12"></a>12. After this, the coast now inclining to the
south, succeeds the mart of <em class="gesperrt">Arômata</em>, and a
bluff headland running out eastward which
forms the termination of the Barbarine coast.
The roadstead is an open one, and at certain
seasons dangerous, as the place lies exposed to
the north wind. A coming storm gives warning
of its approach by a peculiar prognostic, for the
sea turns turbid at the bottom and changes its
colour. When this occurs, all hasten for refuge
to the great promontory called <em class="gesperrt">Tabai</em>, which
affords a secure shelter. The imports into this
mart are such as have been already mentioned;
while its products are cinnamon, gizeir (<i>a finer
sort of cinnamon</i>), asuphê (<i>an ordinary sort</i>),
fragrant gums, magla, motô (<i>an inferior cinnamon</i>),
and frankincense.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(12) We come now to the great projection
Cape Arômata, which is a continuation of Mount
Elephant. It is called in Arabic <em class="gesperrt">Jerd Hafûn</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
or Ras Asir; in Idrisi, <em class="gesperrt">Carfouna</em>, whence the
name by which it is generally known. [The South
point 11°&nbsp;40´ is Râs Shenarif or Jerd Hafûn;
the N. point 11°&nbsp;51´ is Râs 'Asir.] It formed
the limit of the knowledge of this coast in the
time of Strabo, by whom it is called <em class="gesperrt">Notou
Keras</em> or South Horn. It is described as a
very high bluff point and as perpendicular as if
it were scarped. [Jerd Hafûn is 2500 feet high.]
The current comes round it out of the gulf with
such violence that it is not to be stemmed without
a brisk wind, and during the South-West
Monsoon, the moment you are past the Cape to
the North there is a stark calm with insufferable
heat. The current below Jerd Hafûn is noticed by
the <i>Periplûs</i> as setting to the South, and is there
perhaps equally subject to the change of the
monsoon. With this account of the coast from
the straits to the great Cape may be compared
that which has been given by Strabo, XVI. iv. 14:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a><br /><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<p>“From <em class="gesperrt">Deirê</em> the next country is that which
bears aromatic plants. The first produces myrrh
and belongs to the <em class="gesperrt">Ichthyophagi</em> and
<em class="gesperrt">Creophagi</em>. It bears also the persea, peach or
Egyptian almond, and the Egyptian fig. Beyond is
<em class="gesperrt">Licha</em>, a hunting ground for elephants. There
are also in many places standing pools of rainwater.
When these are dried up, the elephants
with their trunks and tusks dig holes and find
water. On this coast there are two very large
lakes extending as far as the promontory Pytholaus.
One of them contains salt water and is
called a sea; the other fresh water and is the
haunt of hippopotami and crocodiles. On the
margin grows the papyrus. The ibis is seen in
the neighbourhood of this place. Next is the
country which produces frankincense; it has a
promontory and a temple with a grove of poplars.
In the inland parts is a tract along the banks of a
river bearing the name of <em class="gesperrt">Isis</em>, and another that
of <em class="gesperrt">Nilus</em>, both of which produce myrrh and frankincense.
Also a lagoon filled with water from the
mountains. Next the watch-post of the Lion and
the port of <em class="gesperrt">Pythangelus</em>. The next tract
bears the false cassia. There are many tracts
in succession on the sides of rivers on which
frankincense grows, and rivers extending to the
cinnamon country. The river which bounds this
tract produces rushes (φλους) in great abundance.
Then follows another river and the port of
<em class="gesperrt">Daphnus</em>, and a valley called <em class="gesperrt">Apollo</em>’s which
bears besides frankincense, myrrh and cinnamon.
The latter is more abundant in places far in the
interior. Next is the mountain <em class="gesperrt">Elephas</em>, a
mountain projecting into the sea and a creek; then
follows the large harbour of <em class="gesperrt">Psygmus</em>, a watering
place called that of <em class="gesperrt">Kunocephali</em> and the
last promontory of this coast <em class="gesperrt">Notu-ceras</em> (or the
Southern Horn). After doubling this cape towards
the south we have no more descriptions of harbours
or places because nothing is known of the sea-coast
beyond this point.” [Bohn’s <i>Transl.</i>] According
to Gosselin, the Southern Horn corresponds with
the Southern Cape of Bandel-caus, where commences
the desert coast of Ajan, the ancient
<em class="gesperrt">Azania</em>.</p>

<p>According to the <i>Periplûs</i> Cape <em class="gesperrt">Arômata</em>
marked the termination of <em class="gesperrt">Barbaria</em> and the
beginning of <em class="gesperrt">Azania</em>. Ptolemy however distinguishes
them differently, defining the former as
the interior and the latter as the sea-board of the
region to which these names were applied.</p>

<p>The description of the Eastern Coast of Africa
which now follows is carried, as has been already
noticed, as far as <em class="gesperrt">Rhapta</em>, a place about 6 degrees
South of the Equator, but which Vincent places
much farther South, identifying it with Kilwa.</p>

<p>The places named on this line of coast are:
a promontory called <em class="gesperrt">Tabai</em>, a Khersonesos;
<em class="gesperrt">Opônê</em>, a mart; the Little and the Great <em class="gesperrt">Apokopa</em>;
the Little and the Great Coast; the
<em class="gesperrt">Dromoi</em> or courses of <em class="gesperrt">Azania</em> (first that of
<em class="gesperrt">Serapiôn</em>, then that of <em class="gesperrt">Nikôn</em>); a number of
rivers; a succession of anchorages, seven in number;
the <em class="gesperrt">Paralaoi</em> islands; a strait or canal;
the island of <em class="gesperrt">Menouthias</em>; and then <em class="gesperrt">Rhapta</em>,
beyond which, as the author conceived, the ocean
curved round Africa until it met and amalgamated
with the Hesperian or Western Ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_13"></a>13. If, on sailing from <em class="gesperrt">Tabai</em>, you follow
the coast of the peninsula <i>formed by the promontory</i>,
you are carried by the force of a strong
current to another mart 400 stadia distant, called
<em class="gesperrt">Opônê</em>, which imports the commodities already
mentioned, but produces most abundantly
cinnamon, spice, <i>motô</i>, slaves of a very superior
sort, chiefly for the Egyptian market, and tortoise-shell
of small size but in large quantity
and of the finest quality known.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(13) Tabai, to which the inhabitants of the Great
Cape fled for refuge on the approach of a storm,
cannot, as Vincent and others have supposed, be
Cape Orfui, for it lay at too great a distance for
the purpose. The projection is meant which the
Arabs call Banna. [Or, Tabai may be identified
with Râs Shenarif, lat. 11°&nbsp;40´ N.] Tabai, Müller
suggests, may be a corruption for Tabannai.</p>

<p>“From the foreign term Banna,” he says,
“certain Greeks in the manner of their countrymen
invented <em class="gesperrt">Panos</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Panôn</em> or Panô or Panôna
Kômê. Thus in Ptolemy (I. 17 and IV. 7) after
Arômata follows <em class="gesperrt">Panôn Kômê</em>, which Mannert
has identified with Benna. [Khor Banneh is a salt
lake, with a village, inside Râs Ali Beshgêl, lat. 11°&nbsp;9´
N., long. 51°&nbsp;9´ E.] Stephen of Byzantium may be
compared, who speaks of <em class="gesperrt">Panos</em> as a village on
the Red Sea which is also called <em class="gesperrt">Panôn</em>.” The
conjecture, therefore, of Letronnius that <em class="gesperrt">Panôn
Kômê</em> derived its name from the large apes
found there, called <em class="gesperrt">Pânes</em>, falls to the ground.
<em class="gesperrt">Opônê</em> was situated on the Southern shores
of what the <i>Periplûs</i> calls a Khersonese, which
can only be the projection now called <em class="gesperrt">Ras
Hafûn</em> or Cape D’Orfui (lat. 10°&nbsp;25´ N.).
Ptolemy (I. 17) gives the distance of <em class="gesperrt">Opônê</em>
from <em class="gesperrt">Panôn Kômê</em> at a 6 days’ journey, from
which according to the <i>Periplûs</i> it was only
400 stadia distant. That the text of Ptolemy is
here corrupt cannot be doubted, for in his tables
the distance between the two places is not far from
that which is given in the <i>Periplûs</i>. Probably,
as Müller conjectures, he wrote ὁδόν ἡμέρας (a day’s
journey) which was converted into ὁδόν ἡμερ. ϛ´ (a
six-days’ journey).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_14"></a>14. Ships set sail from Egypt for all these
ports beyond the straits about the month of
July—that is, Epiphi. The same markets are
also regularly supplied with the products of
places far beyond them—<em class="gesperrt">Ariakê</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em>.
These products are—</p>

<p>Σῖτος —Corn.</p>

<p>Ὀρυζα<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>—Rice.</p>

<p>Μέλι τὸ καλάμινον τὸ λεγόμενον σάκχαρι—The

<p>Some traders undertake voyages for this
commerce expressly, while others, as they sail
along the coast <i>we are describing</i>, exchange
their cargoes for such others as they can procure.
There is no king who reigns paramount over all
this region, but each separate seat of trade is
ruled by an independent despot of its own.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(14) At this harbour is introduced the mention
of the voyage which was annually made between
the coast of India and Africa in days previous to
the appearance of the Greeks on the Indian Ocean,
which has already been referred to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_15"></a>15. After <em class="gesperrt">Opônê</em>, the coast now trending
more to the south, you come first to what are
called the little and the great <em class="gesperrt">Apokopa</em> (or
Bluffs) of <em class="gesperrt">Azania</em>, where there are no
harbours, but only roads in which ships can conveniently
anchor. The navigation of this coast,
the direction of which is now to the south-west,
occupies six days. Then follow the Little
Coast and the Great Coast, occupying other six
days, when in due order succeed the <em class="gesperrt">Dromoi</em>
(or Courses) of <em class="gesperrt">Azania</em>, the one going
by the name of <em class="gesperrt">Sarapiôn</em>, and the other
by that of <em class="gesperrt">Nikôn</em>. Proceeding thence, you
pass the mouths of numerous rivers, and a succession
of other roadsteads lying apart one
from another a day’s distance either by sea or by
land. There are seven of them altogether, and
they reach on to the <em class="gesperrt">Puralaoi</em> islands and the
<i>narrow strait</i> called the Canal, beyond which,
where the coast changes its direction from south-west
slightly more to south, you are conducted
by a voyage of two days and two nights to
<em class="gesperrt">Menouthias</em>, an island stretching towards sunset,
and distant from the mainland about 300 stadia.
It is low-lying and woody, has rivers, and a
vast variety of birds, and yields the mountain
tortoise, but it has no wild beasts at all, except
only crocodiles, which, however, are quite
harmless. The boats are here made of planks
sewn together attached to a keel formed of a
single log of wood, and these are used for fishing
and for catching turtle. This is also caught in
another mode, peculiar to the island, by lowering
wicker-baskets instead of nets, and fixing
them against the mouths of the cavernous
rocks which lie out in the sea confronting the
beach.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(15) After leaving <em class="gesperrt">Opônê</em> the coast first runs
due south, then bends to the south-west, and here
begins the coast which is called the Little and the
Great <em class="gesperrt">Apokopa</em> or Bluffs of <em class="gesperrt">Azania</em>, the
voyage along which occupies six days. This rocky
coast, as we learn from recent explorations, begins
at <em class="gesperrt">Râs Mabber</em> [about lat. 9°&nbsp;25´ N.], which is
between 70 and 80 miles distant from Ras Hafûn and
extends only to <em class="gesperrt">Râs-ul-Kheil</em> [about lat. 7°&nbsp;45´
N.], which is distant from Râs Mabber about 140
miles or a voyage of three or four days only. The
length of this rocky coast (called <em class="gesperrt">Hazine</em> by the
Arabs) is therefore much exaggerated in the <i>Peri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>plûs</i>.
From this error we may infer that our author,
who was a very careful observer, had not personally
visited this coast. Ptolemy, in opposition to Marînos
as well as the <i>Periplûs</i>, recognizes but one
<em class="gesperrt">Apokopa</em>, which he speaks of as a bay. Müller
concludes an elaborate note regarding the <em class="gesperrt">Apokopa</em>
by the following quotation from the work of
Owen, who made the exploration already referred to,
“It is strange that the descriptive term <em class="gesperrt">Hazine</em>
should have produced the names <em class="gesperrt">Ajan</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Azan</em>
and <em class="gesperrt">Azania</em> in many maps and charts, as the
country never had any other appellation than
<em class="gesperrt">Barra Somâli</em> or the land of the <em class="gesperrt">Somâli</em>,
a people who have never yet been collected under
one government, and whose limits of subjection
are only within bow-shot of individual chiefs.
The coast of Africa from the Red Sea to the river
Juba is inhabited by the tribe called <em class="gesperrt">Somâli</em>.
They are a mild people of pastoral habits and
confined entirely to the coast; the whole of the
interior being occupied by an untameable tribe of
savages called <em class="gesperrt">Galla</em>.”</p>

<p>The coast which follows the <em class="gesperrt">Apokopa</em>, called
the Little and the Great <em class="gesperrt">Aigialos</em> or Coast,
is so desolate that, as Vincent remarks, not a
name occurs on it, neither is there an anchorage
noticed, nor the least trace of commerce to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
found. Yet it is of great extent—a six days’
voyage according to the <i>Periplûs</i>, but, according
to Ptolemy, who is here more correct, a voyage of
eight days, for, as we have seen, the <i>Periplûs</i> has
unduly extended the <em class="gesperrt">Apokopa</em> to the South.</p>

<p>Next follow the <em class="gesperrt">Dromoi</em> or Courses of
<em class="gesperrt">Azania</em>, the first called that of <em class="gesperrt">Serapiôn</em>
and the other that of <em class="gesperrt">Nikôn</em>. Ptolemy interposes
a bay between the Great Coast and the port
of <em class="gesperrt">Serapiôn</em>, on which he states there was
an emporium called <em class="gesperrt">Essina</em>—a day’s sail distant
from that port. Essina, it would therefore
appear, must have been somewhere near where
<em class="gesperrt">Makdashû</em> [Magadoxo, lat. 2°&nbsp;3´ N.] was built
by the Arabs somewhere in the eighth century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
The station called that of <em class="gesperrt">Nikôn</em> in the <i>Periplûs</i>
appears in Ptolemy as the mart of <em class="gesperrt">Tonikê</em>.
These names are not, as some have supposed, of
Greek origin, but distortions of the native appellations
of the places into names familiar to Greek
ears. That the Greeks had founded any settlements
here is altogether improbable. At the
time when the <i>Periplûs</i> was written all the trade
of these parts was in the hands of the Arabs of
<em class="gesperrt">Mouza</em>. The port of <em class="gesperrt">Serapiôn</em> may be
placed at a promontory which occurs in 1°&nbsp;40´
of N. lat. From this, <em class="gesperrt">Tonikê</em>, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the tables of Ptolemy, was distant 45´, and its
position must therefore have agreed with that of
<em class="gesperrt">Torre</em> or Torra of our modern maps.</p>

<p>Next occurs a succession of rivers and roadsteads,
seven in number, which being passed we
are conducted to the <em class="gesperrt">Puralaän</em> Islands, and
what is called a canal or channel (διώρυξ). These
islands are not mentioned elsewhere. They can
readily be identified with the two called <em class="gesperrt">Manda</em>
and <em class="gesperrt">Lamou</em>, which are situate at the mouths of
large rivers, and are separated from the mainland
and from each other by a narrow channel. Vincent
would assign a Greek origin to the name of
these islands. “With a very slight alteration,”
he says, “of the reading, the Puralian Islands
(Πῦρ ἁλιον, <i>marine fire</i>,) are the islands of the
Fiery Ocean, and nothing seems more consonant
to reason than for a Greek to apply the name of
the Fiery Ocean to a spot which was the centre
of the Torrid Zone and subject to the perpendicular
rays of an equinoctial sun.” [The Juba
islands run along the coast from Juba to about
Lat. 1°&nbsp;50´ S., and Manda bay and island is in Lat.
2°&nbsp;12´ S.]</p>

<p>Beyond these islands occurs, after a voyage
of two days and two nights, the island of <em class="gesperrt">Menouthias</em>
or <em class="gesperrt">Menouthesias</em>, which it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
been found difficult to identify with any certainty.
“It is,” says Vincent, “the <i>Eitenediommenouthesias</i>
of the <i>Periplûs</i>, a term egregiously strange and
corrupted, but out of which the commentators
unanimously collect Menoothias, whatever may be
the fate of the remaining syllables. That this Menoothias,”
he continues, “must have been one of
the Zangibar islands is indubitable; for the distance
from the coast of all three, Pemba, Zangibar,
and Momfia, affords a character which is indelible;
a character applicable to no other island from
Guardafui to Madagascar.” He then identifies
it with the island of Zangibar, lat. 6°&nbsp;5´ S., in preference
to Pemba, 5°&nbsp;6´ S., which lay too far out
of the course, and in preference to Momfia, 7°&nbsp;50´
S. (though more doubtfully), because of its being
by no means conspicuous, whereas Zangibar was
so prominent and obvious above the other two,
that it might well attract the particular attention
of navigators, and its distance from the mainland
is at the same time so nearly in accordance with
that given in the <i>Periplûs</i> as to counterbalance all
other objections. A writer in Smith’s <i>Classical
Geography</i>, who seems to have overlooked the indications
of the distances both of Ptolemy and the
<i>Periplûs</i>, assigns it a position much further to the
north than is reconcilable with these distances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
He places it about a degree south from the mouth
of the River Juba or Govind, just where an opening
in the coral-reefs is now found. “The coasting
voyage,” he says, “steering S. W., reached the
island on the east side—a proof that it was close
to the main.... It is true the navigator
says it was 300 stadia from the mainland; but as
there is no reason to suppose that he surveyed
the island, this distance must be taken to signify
the estimated width of the northern inlet separating
the island from the main, and this estimate
is probably much exaggerated. The mode of
fishing with baskets is still practised in the Juba
islands and along this coast. The formation of
the coast of E. Africa in these latitudes—where
the hills or downs upon the coast are all formed
of a coral conglomerate comprising fragments
of madrepore, shell and sand, renders it likely
that the island which was close to the main 16 or
17 centuries ago, should now be united to it.
Granting this theory of gradual transformation of
the coast-line, the <em class="gesperrt">Menouthias</em> of the <i>Periplûs</i>
may be supposed to have stood in what is now
the rich garden-land of <em class="gesperrt">Shamba</em>, where the
rivers carrying down mud to mingle with the
marine deposit of coral drift covered the choked-up
estuary with a rich soil.”</p>

<p>The island is said in the <i>Periplûs</i> to extend
towards the West, but this does not hold good
either in the case of Zangibar or any other island
in this part of the coast. Indeed there is no one
of them in which at the present day all the
characteristics of <em class="gesperrt">Menouthias</em> are found combined.
<em class="gesperrt">Momfia</em>, for instance, which resembles
it somewhat in name, and which, as modern
travellers tell us, is almost entirely occupied with
birds and covered with their dung, does not
possess any streams of water. These are found
in Zangibar. The author may perhaps have confusedly
blended together the accounts he had
received from his Arab informants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_16"></a>16. At the distance of a two days’ sail from
this island lies the last of the marts of <em class="gesperrt">Azania</em>,
called <em class="gesperrt">Rhapta</em>, a name which it derives
from the sewn boats just mentioned. Ivory is
procured here in the greatest abundance, and
also turtle. The indigenous inhabitants are
men of huge stature, who live <i>apart from each
other</i>, every man ruling like a lord his own
domain. The whole territory is governed by
the despot of <em class="gesperrt">Mopharitis</em>, because the
sovereignty over it, by some right of old standing,
is vested in the kingdom of what is called the
First Arabia. The merchants of <em class="gesperrt">Mouza</em> farm
its revenues from the king, and employ in trading
with it a great many ships of heavy burden,
on board of which they have Arabian commanders
and factors who are intimately acquainted
with the natives and have contracted marriage
with them, and know their language and the
navigation of the coast.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(16) We arrive next and finally at <em class="gesperrt">Rhapta</em>, the
last emporium on the coast known to the author.
Ptolemy mentions not only a city of this name,
but also a river and a promontory. The name
is Greek (from ῥάπτειν, <i>to sew</i>), and was applied
to the place because the vessels there in use
were raised from bottoms consisting of single
trunks of trees by the addition of planks which
were sewn together with the fibres of the cocoa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
“It is a singular fact,” as Vincent remarks, “that
this peculiarity should be one of the first objects
which attracted the attention of the Portuguese
upon their reaching this coast. They saw them
first at Mozambique, where they were called
<i>Almeidas</i>, but the principal notice of them in
most of their writers is generally stated at
Kilwa, the very spot which we have supposed to
receive its name from vessels of the same construction.”
Vincent has been led from this coincidence
to identify Rhapta with Kilwa [lat. 8°&nbsp;50´ S.].
Müller however would place it not so far south,
but somewhere in the Bay of Zangibar. The
promontory of <em class="gesperrt">Rhaptum</em>, he judges from the
indications of the <i>Periplûs</i> to be the projection
which closes the bay in which lies the island of
Zangibar, and which is now known as <em class="gesperrt">Moinanokalû</em>
or Point Pouna, lat. 7° S. The parts beyond
this were unknown, and the southern coast of
Africa, it was accordingly thought by the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
geographers, began here. Another cape however
is mentioned by Ptolemy remoter than Rhaptum
and called <em class="gesperrt">Prasum</em> (that is the Green Cape)
which may perhaps be Cape Delgado, which is
noted for its luxuriant vegetation. The same author
calls the people of <em class="gesperrt">Rhapta</em>, the <em class="gesperrt">Rhapsioi
Aithiopes</em>. They are described in the <i>Periplûs</i>
as men of lofty stature, and this is still a characteristic
of the Africans of this coast. The
<em class="gesperrt">Rhapsii</em> were, in the days of our author, subject
to the people of <em class="gesperrt">Mouza</em> in Arabia just as their
descendants are at the present day subject to the
Sultan of Maskat. Their commerce moreover still
maintains its ancient characteristics. It is the
African who still builds and mans the ships while
the Arab is the navigator and supercargo. The
ivory is still of inferior quality, and the turtle is
still captured at certain parts of the coast.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_17"></a>17. The articles imported into these marts
are principally javelins manufactured at Mouza,
hatchets, knives, awls, and crown glass of various
sorts, to which must be added corn and wine
in no small quantity landed at particular ports,
not for sale, but to entertain and thereby conciliate
the barbarians. The articles which these
places export are ivory, in great abundance
but of inferior quality to that obtained at
Adouli, rhinoceros, and tortoise-shell of fine
quality, second only to the Indian, and a little
<i>nauplius</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="para_18"></a>18. These marts, we may say, are about the
last on the coast of <em class="gesperrt">Azania</em>—the coast, that is,
which is on your right as you sail <i>south</i> from
<em class="gesperrt">Berenîkê</em>. For beyond these parts an ocean,
hitherto unexplored, curves round towards sunset,
and, stretching along the southern extremities
of Ethiopia, Libya, and Africa, amalgamates
with the Western Sea.</p>

<p><a id="para_19"></a>19. To the left, again, of <em class="gesperrt">Berenikê</em>, if you
sail eastward from <em class="gesperrt">Myos-Hormos</em> across the
adjacent gulf for two days, or perhaps three, you
arrive at a place having a port and a fortress
which is called <em class="gesperrt">Leukê Kômê</em>, and forming the
point of communication with Petra, the residence
of <em class="gesperrt">Malikhas</em>, the king of the Nabatæans. It
ranks as an emporium of trade, since small
vessels come to it laden with merchandize from
Arabia; and hence an officer is deputed to
collect the duties which are levied on imports
at the rate of twenty-five per cent. of their
value, and also a centurion who commands the
garrison by which the place is protected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(18, 19) Our author having thus described the
African coast as far southward as it was known on
its Eastern side, reverts to <em class="gesperrt">Berenikê</em> and enters
at once on a narrative of the second voyage—that
which was made thence across the Northern head
of the gulf and along the coast of Arabia to the emporium
of <em class="gesperrt">Mouza</em> near the Straits. The course
is first northward, and the parts about <em class="gesperrt">Berenikê</em>
as you bear away lie therefore now on your left hand.
Having touched at <em class="gesperrt">Myos Hormos</em> the course
on leaving it is shaped eastward across the gulf by
the promontory <em class="gesperrt">Pharan</em>, and <em class="gesperrt">Leukê Kômê</em><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
is reached after three or four days’ sailing. This
was a port in the kingdom of the Nabathæans
(the Nebaioth of Scripture), situated perhaps near
the mouth of the Elanitic Gulf or eastern arm of
the Red Sea, now called the Gulf of Akabah.
Much difference of opinion has prevailed as to
its exact position, since the encroachment of the
land upon the sea has much altered the line of
coast here. Mannert identified it with the modern
<em class="gesperrt">Yenbo</em> [lat. 24°&nbsp;5´ N., long. 38°&nbsp;3´ E., the port<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of Medina], Gosselin with <em class="gesperrt">Mowilah</em> [lat. 27°
38´ N., long. 35°&nbsp;28´ E.,] Vincent with <em class="gesperrt">Eynounah</em>
[lat. 28°&nbsp;3´ N., long. 35°&nbsp;13´ E.—the <em class="gesperrt">Onne</em> of
Ptolemy], Reichhard with <em class="gesperrt">Istabel Antai</em>, and
Rüppel with <em class="gesperrt">Wejh</em> [lat. 26°&nbsp;13´ N., long. 36°
27´ E]. Müller prefers the opinion held by Bochart,
D’Anville, Quatremêre, Noel des Vergers, and
Ritter, who agree in placing it at the port called
<em class="gesperrt">Hauara</em> [lat. 24°&nbsp;59´ N., long. 37°&nbsp;16´ E.] mentioned
by Idrisi (I. p. 332), who describes it as a
village inhabited by merchants carrying on a considerable
trade in earthen vases manufactured at
a clay-pit in their neighbourhood. Near it lies
the island of <em class="gesperrt">Hassani</em> [lat. 24°&nbsp;59´ N., long.
37°&nbsp;3´ E.], which, as Wellsted reports, is conspicuous
from its <i>white</i> appearance. <em class="gesperrt">Leukê
Kômê</em> is mentioned by various ancient authors,
as for instance Strabo, who, in a passage wherein
he recounts the misfortunes which befel the
expedition which Aelius led into Nabathaea,
speaks of the place as a large mart to which and
from which the camel traders travel with ease
and in safety from <em class="gesperrt">Petra</em> and back to <em class="gesperrt">Petra</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
with so large a body of men and camels as to
differ in no respect from an army.</p>

<p>The merchandize thus conveyed from <em class="gesperrt">Leukê
Kômê</em> to <em class="gesperrt">Petra</em> was passed on to <em class="gesperrt">Rhinokoloura</em>
in Palestine near Egypt, and
thence to other nations, but in his own time the
greater part was transported by the Nile to
<em class="gesperrt">Alexandria</em>. It was brought down from India
and Arabia to <em class="gesperrt">Myos Hormos</em>, whence it was
first conveyed on camels to <em class="gesperrt">Koptos</em> and thence
by the Nile to <em class="gesperrt">Alexandria</em>. The Nabathaean
king, at the time when our author visited <em class="gesperrt">Leukê
Kômê</em>, was, as he tells us, <em class="gesperrt">Malikhas</em>, a name
which means ‘king.’ Two Petraean sovereigns so
called are mentioned by Josêphos, of whom the latter
was contemporary with Herod. The Malikhas of
the <i>Periplûs</i> is however not mentioned in any other
work. The Nabathaean kingdom was subverted
in the time of Trajan, A.D. 105, us we learn from Dio
Cassius (cap. lxviii. 14), and from Eutropius
(viii. 2, 9), and from Ammianus Marcellinus (xiv. 8).</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_20"></a>20. Beyond this mart, and quite contiguous
to it, is the realm of Arabia, which stretches to a
great distance along the coast of the Red Sea.
It is inhabited by various tribes, some speaking
the same language with a certain degree of
uniformity, and others a language totally different.
Here also, <i>as on the opposite continent</i>, the
sea-board is occupied by <em class="gesperrt">Ikhthyophagoi</em>,
who live in dispersed huts; while the men of the
interior live either in villages, or where pasture
can be found, and are an evil race of men,
speaking two different languages. If a vessel
is driven from her course upon this shore she
is plundered, and if wrecked the crew on
escaping to land are reduced to slavery. For
this reason they are treated as enemies and captured
by the chiefs and kings of Arabia. They
are called <em class="gesperrt">Kanraîtai</em>. Altogether, therefore,
the navigation of this part of the Arabian coast
is very dangerous: for, <i>apart from the barbarity
of its people</i>, it has neither harbours nor good
roadsteads, and it is foul with breakers, and
girdled with rocks which render it inaccessible.
For this reason when sailing south we stand off
from a shore in every way so dreadful, and
keep our course down the middle of the gulf,
straining our utmost to reach <i>the more civilized
part</i> of Arabia, which begins at Burnt Island.
From this onward the people are under a regular
government, and, as their country is pastoral,
they keep herds of cattle and camels.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(20) At no great distance from <em class="gesperrt">Leukê Kômê</em>
the Nabathaean realm terminates and Arabia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
begins. The coast is here described as most dismal,
and as in every way dangerous to navigation.
The inhabitants at the same time are barbarians,
destitute of all humanity, who scruple not to
attack and plunder wrecked ships and to make
slaves of their crews if they escaped to land. The
mariner therefore, shunned these inhospitable
shores, and standing well out to sea, sailed down
the middle of the gulf. The tribe here spoken of
was that perhaps which is represented by the
<em class="gesperrt">Hutemi</em> of the present day, and the coast belonged
to the part of Arabia now called <em class="gesperrt">Hejid</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>A more civilized region begins at an island
called Burnt island, which answers to the modern
Zebâyir [about lat. 15°&nbsp;5´ N., long. 42°&nbsp;12´ E.],
an island which was till recently volcanic.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_21"></a>21. Beyond this tract, and on the shore of a
bay which occurs at the termination of the left
(or east) side of the gulf, is <em class="gesperrt">Mouza</em>, an established
and notable mart of trade, at a distance
south from Berenikê of not more than 12,000
stadia. The whole place is full of Arabian shipmasters
and common sailors, and is absorbed
in the pursuits of commerce, for with ships of its
own fitting out, it trades with the marts beyond
the Straits on the opposite coast, and also with
<em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em>.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(21) Beyond this is the great emporium called
<em class="gesperrt">Mouza</em>, [lat. 13°&nbsp;43´ N., long. 43°&nbsp;5´ 14´´ E.] situated
in a bay near the termination of the Gulf, and at a
distance from <em class="gesperrt">Berenikê</em> of 12,000 stadia. Here
the population consists almost entirely of merchants
and mariners, and the place is in the highest degree
commercial. The commodities of the country are
rich and numerous (though this is denied by
Pliny), and there is a great traffic in Indian
articles brought from <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em> (Bharoch).
This port, once the most celebrated and most frequented
in Yemen, is now the village Musa about
twenty-five miles north from Mokhâ, which has
replaced it as a port, the foundation of which dates
back no more than 400 years ago. “Twenty miles
inland from Mokhâ,” says Vincent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> “Niebuhr discovered
a Musa still existing, which he with great
probability supposes to be the ancient mart now
carried inland to this distance by the recession of
the coast.” [He must have confounded it with
<em class="gesperrt">Jebel Musa</em>, due east of Mokhâ, at the commencement
of the mountain country.] It is a
mere village badly built. Its water is good, and
is said to be drunk by the wealthier inhabitants
of Mokhâ. Bochart identified <em class="gesperrt">Mouza</em> with the
<em class="gesperrt">Mesha</em> mentioned by Moses.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_22"></a>22. Above this a three days’ journey off lies the
city of <em class="gesperrt">Sauê</em>, in the district called <em class="gesperrt">Mopharitis</em>.
It is the residence of <em class="gesperrt">Kholaibos</em>, the
despot of that country.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(22) The <i>Periplûs</i> notices two cities that lay
inland from <em class="gesperrt">Mouza</em>—the 1st <em class="gesperrt">Sauê</em>, the <em class="gesperrt">Savê</em>
of Pliny (VI. xxvi., 104), and also of Ptolemy
(VI. vii., p. 411), who places it at a distance of
500 stadia S. E. of Mouza. The position and
distance direct us to the city of <em class="gesperrt">Taaes</em>, which lies
near a mountain called Saber. <em class="gesperrt">Sauê</em> belonged to a
district called <em class="gesperrt">Mapharitis</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Mophareitês</em>,
a name which appears to survive in the modern
<em class="gesperrt">Mharras</em>, which designates a mountain lying
N. E. from <em class="gesperrt">Taaes</em>. It was ruled by <em class="gesperrt">Kholaibos</em>
(Arabicé—Khaleb), whom our author calls a tyrant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and who was therefore probably a Sheikh who had
revolted from his lawful chief, and established
himself as an independent ruler.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_23"></a>23. A journey of nine days more conducts us
to <em class="gesperrt">Saphar</em>, the metropolis of <em class="gesperrt">Kharibaêl</em>, the
rightful sovereign of two contiguous tribes, the
<em class="gesperrt">Homerites</em> and the <em class="gesperrt">Sabaïtai</em>, and, by
means of frequent embassies and presents, the
friend of the Emperors.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(23) The other city was <em class="gesperrt">Saphar</em>, the metropolis
of the <em class="gesperrt">Homerîtai</em>, <i>i.e.</i> the <em class="gesperrt">Himaryi</em>—the
Arabs of Yemen, whose power was widely
extended, not only in Yemen but in distant
countries both to the East and West. Saphar is
called <em class="gesperrt">Sapphar</em> by Ptolemy (VI. vii.), who places
it in 14° N. lat. Philostorgios calls it <em class="gesperrt">Tapharon</em>,
and Stephen of Byzantium <em class="gesperrt">Tarphara</em>. It is now
<em class="gesperrt">Dhafar</em> or Dsoffar or Zaphar. In Edrisi (I. p.
148) it appears as <em class="gesperrt">Dhofar</em>, and he thus writes of
it:—“It is the capital of the district Jahsseb. It
was formerly one of the greatest and most famous
of cities. The kings of Yemen made it their
residence, and there was to be seen the palace of
Zeidan. These structures are now in ruins, and
the population has been much decreased, nevertheless
the inhabitants have preserved some
remnants of their ancient riches.” The ruins
of the city and palace still exist in the neighbourhood
of <em class="gesperrt">Jerim</em>, which Niebuhr places
in 14°&nbsp;30´ N. lat. The distance from <em class="gesperrt">Sauê</em> to
<em class="gesperrt">Saphar</em> in the <i>Periplûs</i> is a nine days’ journey.
Niebuhr accomplished it however in six. Perhaps,
as Müller suggests, the nine days’ journey is from
<em class="gesperrt">Mouza</em> to <em class="gesperrt">Saphar</em>. The sovereign of Saphar
is called by our author <em class="gesperrt">Kharibaêl</em>, a name
which is not found among the Himyaritic kings
known from other sources. In Ptolemy the
region is called <em class="gesperrt">Elisarôn</em>, from a king bearing
that name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_24"></a>24. The mart of <em class="gesperrt">Mouza</em> has no harbour, but
its sea is smooth, and the anchorage good, owing
to the sandy nature of the bottom. The commodities
which it imports are—</p>

<p>Πορφύρα, διάφορος καὶ χυδαία—Purple cloth, fine
and ordinary.</p>

<p>Ἱματισμίς Ἀραβικὸς χειριδωτὸς, ὅτε ἁπλοῦς καὶ ὁ
κοινὸς καὶ σκοτουλάτος καὶ διάχρυσος—Garments
made up in the Arabian fashion, some plain and
common, and others wrought in needlework and
inwoven with gold.</p>

<p>Κρόκος—Saffron.</p>

<p>Κύπερος—The aromatic rush Kyperos. (Turmeric?)</p>

<p>Ὀθόνιον—Muslins.</p>

<p>Ἀβόλλαι—Cloaks.</p>

<p>Λώδικες οὐ πολλαὶ, ἁπλοῖ τε καὶ ἐντόπιοι—Quilts, in
small quantity, some plain, others adapted to the
fashion of the country.</p>

<p>Ζῶναι σκιωταὶ—Sashes of various shades of colour.</p>

<p>Μύρον μέτριον—Perfumes, a moderate quantity.</p>

<p>Χρῆμα ἱκανὸν—Specie as much as is required.</p>

<p>Οἶνος—Wine.</p>

<p>Σῖτος οὐ πολύς—Corn, but not much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>The country produces a little wheat and a
great abundance of wine. Both the king and
the despot above mentioned receive presents
consisting of horses, pack-saddle mules, gold
plate, silver plate embossed, robes of great value,
and utensils of brass. <em class="gesperrt">Mouza</em> exports its
own local products—myrrh of the finest quality
that has oozed in drops from the trees, both the
Gabiræan and Minœan kinds; white marble (or
alabaster), in addition to commodities brought
from the other side of the Gulf, all such as were
enumerated at <em class="gesperrt">Adouli</em>. The most favourable
season for making a voyage to Mouza is the month
of September,—that is Thôth,—but there is
nothing to prevent it being made earlier.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(24) Adjacent to the Homeritai, and subject
to them when the <i>Periplûs</i> was written, were the
Sabæans, so famous in antiquity for their wealth,
luxury and magnificence. Their country, the
<em class="gesperrt">Sheba</em> of Scripture, was noted as the land of
frankincense. Their power at one time extended
far and wide, but in the days of our author they
were subject to the Homerites ruled over by
Kharibaêl, who was assiduous in courting the
friendship of Rome.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_25"></a>25. If on proceeding from <em class="gesperrt">Mouza</em> you sail
by the coast for about a distance of 300 stadia,
there occurs, where the Arabian mainland and
the opposite coast of <em class="gesperrt">Barbaria</em> at <em class="gesperrt">Aualitês</em>
now approach each other, a channel of no
great length which contracts the sea and encloses
it within narrow bounds. This is 60 stadia wide,
and in crossing it you come midway upon the
island of <em class="gesperrt">Diodôros</em>, to which it is owing that
the passage of the straits is in its neighbourhood
exposed to violent winds which blow down
from the adjacent mountains. There is situate
upon the shore of the straits an Arabian village
subject to the same ruler (as Mouza), <em class="gesperrt">Okêlis</em>
by name, which is not so much a mart of commerce
as a place for anchorage and supplying
water, and where those who are bound for the
interior first land and halt to refresh themselves.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(25) At a distance of 300 stadia beyond <em class="gesperrt">Mouza</em>
we reach the straits where the shores of Arabia
and Africa advance so near to each other that the
passage between them has only, according to the
<i>Periplûs</i>, a width of 60 stadia, or 7½ miles. In the
midst of the passage lies the island of <em class="gesperrt">Diodôros</em>
(now Perim), which is about 4½ miles long
by 2 broad, and rises 230 feet above the level of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
sea. The straits, according to Moresby, are 14½
geographical miles wide at the entrance between
Bab-el-Mandab Cape (near which is Perim) and
the opposite point or volcanic peak called <em class="gesperrt">Jibel
Sijan</em>. The larger of the two entrances is 11 miles
wide, and the other only 1½. Strabo, Agathêmeros,
and Pliny all agree with the <i>Periplûs</i> in giving 60
stadia as the breadth of the straits. The first
passage of those dreaded straits was regarded as
a great achievement, and was naturally ascribed
to Sesostris as the voyage though the straits of
Kalpê was ascribed to Heraklês.</p>

<p>Situated on the shores of the straits was
a place called <em class="gesperrt">Okêlis</em>. This was not a
mart of commerce, but merely a bay with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
good anchorage and well supplied with water.
It is identical with the modern Ghalla or
Cella, which has a bay immediately within the
straits. Strabo following Artemidoros notes here
a promontory called <em class="gesperrt">Akila</em>. Pliny (VI. xxxii. 157)
mentions an emporium of the same name “ex
quo in Indiam navigatur.” In xxvi., 104 of the
same Book he says: “Indos petentibus utilissimum
est ab <em class="gesperrt">Oceli</em> egredi.” Ptolemy mentions
a <em class="gesperrt">Pseudokêlis</em>, which he places at the distance
of half a degree from the emporium of
<em class="gesperrt">Okêlis</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_26"></a>26. Beyond <em class="gesperrt">Okêlis</em>, the sea again widening
out towards the east, and gradually expanding
into the open main, there lies, at about the distance
of 1,200 stadia, <em class="gesperrt">Eudaimôn Arabia</em>,
a maritime village subject to that kingdom of
which Kharibaêl is sovereign—a place with good
anchorage, and supplied with sweeter and better
water than that of Okêlis, and standing at
the entrance of a bay where the land begins to
retire inwards. It was called Eudaimôn (‘rich
and prosperous’), because in bygone days, when
the merchants from India did not proceed
to Egypt, and those from Egypt did not venture
to cross over to the marts further east, but both
came only as far as this city, it formed the common
centre of their commerce, as Alexandria
receives the wares which pass to and fro
between Egypt and the ports of the Mediterranean.
Now, however, it lies in ruins, the
Emperor having destroyed it not long before
our own times.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(26) At a distance beyond <em class="gesperrt">Okêlis</em> of 1,200
stadia is the port of <em class="gesperrt">Eudaimôn Arabia</em>, which
beyond doubt corresponds to <em class="gesperrt">'Âden</em>, [lat. 12°
45´ N., long. 45°&nbsp;21´ E.] now so well-known as
the great packet station between Suez and India.
The opinion held by some that Aden is the Eden
mentioned by the Prophet Ezekiel (xxvii. 23) is
opposed by Ritter and Winer. It is not mentioned
by Pliny, though it has been erroneously
held that the <em class="gesperrt">Attanae</em>, which he mentions
in the following passage, was Aden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> “Homnae
et Attanae (v. 1. Athanae) quæ nunc oppida
maxima celebrari a Persico mari negotiatores
dicunt.” (vi. 32.) Ptolemy, who calls it simply
<em class="gesperrt">Arabia</em>, speaks of it as an emporium, and places
after it at the distance of a degree and a half
<em class="gesperrt">Melan Horos</em>, or Black Hill, 17 miles from
the coast, which is in long. 46°&nbsp;59´ E. The place,
as the <i>Periplûs</i> informs us, received the name
of <em class="gesperrt">Eudaimôn</em> from the great prosperity and
wealth which it derived from being the great
entrepôt of the trade between India and Egypt.
It was in decay when that work was written, but
even in the time of Ptolemy had begun to show
symptoms of returning prosperity, and in the time
of Constantine it was known as the ‘Roman Emporium,’
and had almost regained its former consequence,
as is gathered from a passage in the
works of the ecclesiastical historian Philostorgios.
It is thus spoken of by Edrisi (I. p. 51): “<em class="gesperrt">'Âden</em>
is a small town, but renowned for its seaport
whence ships depart that are destined for Sind,
India, and China.” In the middle ages it became
again the centre of the trade between India and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the Red Sea, and thus regained that wonderful
prosperity which in the outset had given it its
name. In this flourishing condition it was found
by Marco Polo, whose account of its wealth,
power and influence is, as Vincent remarks,
almost as magnificent as that which Agatharkhidês
attributed to the Sabæans in the time of the
Ptolemies, when the trade was carried on in the
same manner. Agatharkhidês does not however
mention the place by name, but it was probably
the city which he describes without naming it as
lying on the White Sea without the straits, whence,
he says, the Sabæans sent out colonies or factories
into India, and where the fleets from Persis,
Karmania and the Indus arrived. The name of
<em class="gesperrt">Aden</em> is supposed to be a corruption from
<em class="gesperrt">Eudaimôn</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_27"></a>27. To <em class="gesperrt">Eudaimôn Arabia</em> at once succeeds
a great length of coast and a bay extending
2,000 stadia or more, inhabited by nomadic
tribes and Ikhthyophagoi settled in villages.
On doubling a cape which projects from it you
come to another trading seaport, <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em>, which
is subject to <em class="gesperrt">Eleazos</em>, king of the incense
country. Two barren islands lie opposite to it,
120 stadia off—one called <em class="gesperrt">Orneôn</em>, and the
other <em class="gesperrt">Troullas</em>. At some distance inland
from <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em> is <em class="gesperrt">Sabbatha</em>, the principal city
of the district, where the king resides. At
<em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em> is collected all the incense that is produced
in the country, this being conveyed to it
partly on camels, and partly <i>by sea</i> on floats
supported on inflated skins, a local invention,
and also in boats. <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em> carries on trade
with ports across the ocean—<em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em>,
<em class="gesperrt">Skythia</em>, and <em class="gesperrt">Omana</em>, and the adjacent
coast of <em class="gesperrt">Persis</em>.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(27) The coast beyond Aden is possessed partly
by wandering tribes, and partly by tribes settled
in villages which subsist on fish. Here occurs a
bay—that now called Ghubhet-al-Kamar, which
extends upwards of 2,000 stadia, and ends in a
promontory—that now called Râs-al-Asîdah or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Bâ-l-hâf [lat. 13°&nbsp;58´ N., long 48°&nbsp;9´ S.—a cape
with a hill near the fishing village of Gillah].
Beyond this lies another great mart called <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em>.
It is mentioned by Pliny, and also by Ptolemy,
who assigns it a position in agreement with the
indications given in the <i>Periplûs</i>. It has been
identified with the port now called Hisn Ghorâb
[lat. 14°&nbsp;0´ N. long. 48°&nbsp;19´ E.]. Not far from this
is an island called Halanî, which answers to the
<em class="gesperrt">Troullas</em> of our author. Further south is another
island, which is called by the natives of the
adjacent coast <em class="gesperrt">Sikkah</em>, but by sailors Jibûs.
This is covered with the dung of birds which in
countless multitudes have always frequented it,
and may be therefore identified with the <em class="gesperrt">Orneôn</em>
of the <i>Periplûs</i>. <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em> was subject to Eleazos, the
king of the Frankincense Country, who resided at
<em class="gesperrt">Sabbatha</em>, or as it is called by Pliny (VI. xxxii.
155) <em class="gesperrt">Sabota</em>, the capital of the Atramitae or
Adramitae, a tribe of Sabæans from whom the
division of Arabia now known as Hadhramaut
takes its name. The position of this city cannot
be determined with certainty. Wellsted, who pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>ceeded
into the interior from the coast near Hisn
Ghorab through Wadi Meifah, came after a day’s
journey and a half to a place called Nakb-el-Hajar,
situated in a highly cultivated district,
where he found ruins of an ancient city of the
Himyarites crowning an eminence that rose gently
with a double summit from the fertile plain. The
city appeared to have been built in the most solid
style of architecture, and to have been protected by
a very lofty wall formed of square blocks of black
marble, while the inscriptions plainly betokened
that it was an old seat of the Himyarites. A
close similarity could be traced between its ruins
and those of <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em>, to which there was an easy
communication by the valley of <em class="gesperrt">Meifah</em>. This
place, however, can hardly be regarded as <em class="gesperrt">Sabbatha</em>
without setting aside the distances given
by Ptolemy, and Wellsted moreover learned from
the natives that other ruins of a city of not less
size were to be met with near a village called
Esan, which could be reached by a three days’
journey.—(See Haines, <i>Mem. of the S. Coast of
Arab.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_28"></a>28. From Egypt it imports, like Mouza,
corn and a little wheat, cloths for the Arabian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
market, both of the common sort and the plain,
and large quantities of a sort that is adulterated;
also copper, tin, coral, styrax, and all the other
articles enumerated at Mouza. Besides these
there are brought also, principally for the king,
wrought silver plate, and specie as well as
horses and carved images, and plain cloth of
a superior quality. Its exports are its indigenous
products, frankincense and aloes, and such
commodities as it shares in common with other
marts on the same coast. Ships sail for this
port at the same season of the year as those
bound for Mouza, but earlier.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(28) With regard to the staple product of this
region—frankincense, the <i>Periplûs</i> informs us that
it was brought for exportation to <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em>. It was
however in the first place, if we may credit Pliny,
conveyed to the Metropolis. He says (xv. 32)
that when gathered it was carried into <em class="gesperrt">Sabota</em>
on camels which could enter the city only by
one particular gate, and that to take it by any
other route was a crime punished by death. The
priests, he adds, take a tithe for a deity named
<em class="gesperrt">Sabis</em>, and that until this impost is paid, the
article cannot be sold.</p>

<p>Some writers would identify <em class="gesperrt">Sabbatha</em>
with <em class="gesperrt">Mariabo</em> (Marab), but on insufficient
grounds. It has also been conjectured that the
name may be a lengthened form of <em class="gesperrt">Saba</em> (Sheba),
a common appellation for cities in Arabia Felix.
[Müller places Sabbatha at Sawa, lat. 16°&nbsp;13´ N.,
long. 48°&nbsp;9´ E.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_29"></a>29. As you proceed from <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em> the land
retires more and more, and there succeeds
another very deep and far-stretching gulf,
<em class="gesperrt">Sakhalitês</em> by name, and also the frankincense
country, which is mountainous and
difficult of access, having a dense air loaded
with vapours [and] the frankincense exhaled
from the trees. These trees, which are not of any
great size or height, yield their incense in the
form of a concretion on the bark, just as several
of our trees in Egypt exude gum. The incense
is collected by the hand of the king’s slaves, and
malefactors condemned to this service as a
punishment. The country is unhealthy in the
extreme:—pestilential even to those who sail
along the coast, and mortal to the poor wretches
who gather the incense, who also suffer from
lack of food, which readily cuts them off.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(29) The next place mentioned by our author
after <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em> is a Bay called <em class="gesperrt">Sakhalîtes</em>, which
terminates at <em class="gesperrt">Suagros</em>, a promontory which
looks eastward, and is the greatest cape in the
whole world. There was much difference of
opinion among the ancient geographers regarding
the position of this Bay, and consequently regarding
that of Cape <em class="gesperrt">Suagros</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_30"></a>30. Now at this gulf is a promontory, the
greatest in the world, looking towards the east,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and called <em class="gesperrt">Suagros</em>, at which is a fortress
which protects the country, and a harbour, and
a magazine to which the frankincense which is
collected is brought. Out in the open sea,
facing this promontory, and lying between it
and the promontory of <em class="gesperrt">Arômata</em>, which projects
from the opposite coast, though nearer to
<em class="gesperrt">Suagros</em>, is the island going by the name of
<em class="gesperrt">Dioskoridês</em>, which is of great extent, but
desert and very moist, having rivers and crocodiles
and a great many vipers, and lizards of
enormous size, of which the flesh serves for food,
while the grease is melted down and used as a
substitute for oil. This island does not, however,
produce either the grape or corn. The
population, which is but scanty, inhabits the
north side of the island—that part of it which
looks towards the mainland (<i>of Arabia</i>). It
consists of an intermixture of foreigners, Arabs,
Indians, and even Greeks, who resort hither for
the purposes of commerce. The island produces
the tortoise,—the genuine, the land, and
the white sort: the latter very abundant, and
distinguished for the largeness of its shell; also
the mountain sort which is of extraordinary size
and has a very thick shell, whereof the underpart
cannot be used, being too hard to cut,
while the serviceable part is made into moneyboxes,
tablets, escritoires, and ornamental articles
of that description. It yields also the vegetable
dye (κιννάβαρι) called Indicum (or Dragon’s-blood),
which is gathered as it distils from
trees.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(30) Some would identify the latter with Ras-el-Had,
and others on account of the similarity
of the name with Cape <em class="gesperrt">Saugra</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Saukirah</em>
[lat. 18°&nbsp;8´ N., long. 56°&nbsp;35´ E.], where Ptolemy
places a city <em class="gesperrt">Suagros</em> at a distance of 6 degrees
from <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em>, But <em class="gesperrt">Suagros</em> is undoubtedly Ras
Fartak [lat. 15°&nbsp;39´ N., long 52°&nbsp;15´ E.], which is
at a distance of 4 degrees from <em class="gesperrt">Hisn Ghorab</em>,
or <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em>, and which, rising to the height of
2,500 feet on a coast which is all low-lying, is a
very conspicuous object, said to be discernible
from a distance of 60 miles out at sea. Eighteen
miles west from this promontory is a village
called Saghar, a name which might probably
have suggested to the Greeks that of <em class="gesperrt">Suagros</em>.
Consistent with this identification is the passage
of Pliny (VI. 32) where he speaks of the island
<em class="gesperrt">Dioscoridis</em> (Sokotra) as distant from
<em class="gesperrt">Suagros</em>, which he calls the utmost projection
of the coast, 2,240 stadia or 280 miles, which is
only about 30 miles in excess of the real distance,
2,000 stadia.</p>

<p>With regard to the position of the Bay of
Sakhalitês, Ptolemy, followed by Marcianus,
places it to the East of Suagros. Marinos on the
other hand, like the <i>Periplûs</i>, places it to the west
of it. Muller agrees with Fresnel in regarding
<em class="gesperrt">Sakhlê</em>, mentioned by Ptolemy (VI. vii. 41) as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
1½ degree East of Makalleh [lat. 14°&nbsp;31´ N., long
49°&nbsp;7´ W.] as the same with Shehr—which is now
the name of all that mountainous region extending
from the seaport of Makalleh to the bay in which
lie the islands of Kurya Murya. He therefore
takes this to be in the Regio Sakhalîtês, and
rejects the opinion of Ptolemy as inconsistent
with this determination. With regard to Shehr
or Shehar [lat. 14°&nbsp;38´ N., long. 49°&nbsp;22´ E.] Yule
(<i>M. Polo</i>, II. vol. p. 440, note) says: “Shihr or Shehr
still exists on the Arabian Coast as a town and
district about 330 miles east of Aden.” The name
Shehr in some of the oriental geographies includes
the whole Coast up to Oman. The hills of
the Shehr and Dhafâr districts were the great
source of produce of the Arabian frankincense.</p>

<p>The island of <em class="gesperrt">Dioskoridês</em> (now Sokotra)
is placed by the <i>Periplûs</i> nearer to Cape <em class="gesperrt">Suagros</em>
than to Cape <em class="gesperrt">Arômata</em>—although its distance
from the former is nearly double the distance
from the latter. The name, though in appearance
a Greek one, is in reality of Sanskrit origin; from
<i>Dvîpa Sukhâdâra</i>, i.e. <i>insula fortunata</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> ‘Island abode
of Bliss.’ The accuracy of the statements made
regarding it in the <i>Periplûs</i> is fully confirmed by
the accounts given of it by subsequent writers.
Kosmas, who wrote in the 6th century, says that
the inhabitants spoke Greek, and that he met with
people from it who were on their way to Ethiopia,
and that they spoke Greek. “The ecclesiastical
historian Nikephoros Kallistos,” says Yule,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> “seems
to allude to the people of Sokotra when he says
that among the nations visited by the Missionary
Theophilus in the time of Constantius, were ‘the
Assyrians on the verge of the outer Ocean,
towards the East ... whom Alexander the
Great, after driving them from Syria, sent thither
to settle, and to this day they keep their
mother tongue, though all of the blackest, through
the power of the sun’s rays.’ The Arab voyagers
of the 9th century say that the island was
colonized with Greeks by Alexander the Great,
in order to promote the culture of the Sokotrine
aloes; when the other Greeks adopted Christianity
these did likewise, and they had continued to
retain their profession of it. The colonizing by
Alexander is probably a fable, but invented to
account for facts.” (<i>Marco Polo</i> II. 401.) The aloe,
it may be noted, is not mentioned in the <i>Periplûs</i> as
one of the products of the island. The islanders,
though at one time Christians, are now Muhammadans,
and subject as of yore to Arabia. The
people of the interior are still of distinct
race with curly hair, Indian complexion, and
regular features. The coast people are mongrels
of Arab and mixed descent. Probably in old times
civilization and Greek may have been confined
to the littoral foreigners. Marco Polo notes that
so far back as the 10th century it was one of the
stations frequented by the Indian corsairs called
<em class="gesperrt">Bawârij</em>, belonging to Kachh and Gujarat.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_31"></a>31. The island is subject to the king of the
frankincense country, in the same way as
<em class="gesperrt">Azania</em> is subject to Kharibaël and the despot
of <em class="gesperrt">Mopharitis</em>. It used to be visited by
some (<i>merchants</i>) from Mouza, and others on
the homeward voyage from Limurikê and
Barugaza would occasionally touch at it, importing
rice, corn, Indian cotton and female-slaves,
who, being rare, always commanded a ready
market. In exchange for these commodities
they would receive as fresh cargo great quantities
of tortoise-shell. The revenues of the
island are at the present day farmed out by its
sovereigns, who, however, maintain a garrison
in it for the protection of their interests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="para_32"></a>32. Immediately after <em class="gesperrt">Suagros</em> follows a
gulf deeply indenting the mainland of <em class="gesperrt">Omana</em>,
and having a width of 600 stadia. Beyond it
are high mountains, rocky and precipitous, and
inhabited by men who live in caves. The
range extends onward for 500 stadia, and beyond
where it terminates lies an important
harbour called <em class="gesperrt">Moskha</em>, the appointed port to
which the <i>Sakhalitik</i> frankincense is forwarded.
It is regularly frequented by a number
of ships from Kanê; and such ships as come
from Limurikê and Barugaza too late in the
season put into harbour here for the winter,
where they dispose of their muslins, corn, and
oil to the king’s officers, receiving in exchange
frankincense, which lies in piles throughout the
whole of <em class="gesperrt">Sakhalitis</em> without a guard to
protect it, as if the locality were indebted to
some divine power for its security. Indeed, it
is impossible to procure a cargo, either publicly or
by connivance, without the king’s permission.
Should one take furtively on board were it but
a single grain, his vessel can by no possibility
escape from harbour.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(32) Returning to the mainland the narrative
conducts us next to <em class="gesperrt">Moskha</em>, a seaport trading
with <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em>, and a wintering place for vessels
arriving late in the season from Malabar and the
Gulf of Khambât. The distance of this place from
Suagros is set down at upwards of 1,100 stadia,
600 of which represent the breadth of a bay which
begins at the Cape, and is called <em class="gesperrt">Omana
Al-Kamar</em>. The occurrence of the two names
Omana and Moskha in such close connexion led
D’Anville to suppose that <em class="gesperrt">Moskha</em> is identical
with <em class="gesperrt">Maskat</em>, the capital of <em class="gesperrt">Oman</em>, the country
lying at the south-east extremity of Arabia, and
hence that Ras-el-Ḥad, beyond which Maskat lies,
must be Cape Suagros. This supposition is, however,
untenable, since the identification of Moskha
with the modern <em class="gesperrt">Ausera</em> is complete. For,
in the first place, the Bay of Seger, which begins
at Cape Fartak, is of exactly the same measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>ment
across to Cape Thurbot Ali as the Bay of
<em class="gesperrt">Omana</em>, and again the distance from Cape Thurbot
Ali [lat. 16°&nbsp;38´ N., long. 53°&nbsp;3´ E.] to Ras-al-Sair,
the <em class="gesperrt">Ausara</em> of Ptolemy, corresponds almost
as exactly to the distance assigned by our author
from the same Cape to <em class="gesperrt">Moskha</em>. Moreover
Pliny (XII. 35) notices that one particular kind
of incense bore the name of <i>Ausaritis</i>, and, as the
<i>Periplûs</i> states that <em class="gesperrt">Moskha</em> was the great
emporium of the incense trade, the identification
is satisfactory.</p>

<p>There was another Moskha on this coast which
was also a port. It lay to the west of Suagros,
and has been identified with <em class="gesperrt">Koshîn</em> [lat. 15°&nbsp;21´
N. long. 51°&nbsp;39´ E.]. Our author, though correct in
his description of the coast, may perhaps have erred
in his nomenclature; and this is the more likely
to have happened as it scarcely admits of doubt
that he had no personal knowledge of South
Arabia beyond <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em> and Cape <em class="gesperrt">Suagros</em>.
Besides no other author speaks of an Omana
so far to westward as the position assigned to
the Bay of that name. The tract immediately
beyond <em class="gesperrt">Moskha</em> or Ausera is low and fertile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and is called <em class="gesperrt">Dofar</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Zhafâr</em>, after a famous
city now destroyed, but whose ruins are still to be
traced between Al-hâfâh and Addahariz. “This
Dhafâr,” says Yule (<i>Marco Polo</i> II. p. 442 note)
“or the bold fountain above it, is supposed to
be the <em class="gesperrt">Sephar</em> of <i>Genesis</i> X. 30.” It is certain
that the Himyarites had spread their dominion as
far eastward as this place. Marco Polo thus describes
Dhafâr:—“It stands upon the sea, and has
a very good haven, so that there is a great traffic
of shipping between this and India; and the merchants
take hence great numbers of Arab horses
to that market, making great profits thereby....
Much white incense is produced here, and I will
tell you how it grows. The trees are like small
fir-trees; these are notched with a knife in several
places, and from these notches the incense is
exuded. Sometimes, also, it flows from the tree
without any notch, this is by reason of the great
heat of the sun there.” Müller would identify
<em class="gesperrt">Moskha</em> with Zhafâr, and accounts for the discrepancy
of designation by supposing that our author
had confounded the name <em class="gesperrt">Maskat</em>, which was
the great seat of the traffic in frankincense with
the name of the greatest city in the district which
actually produced it. A similar confusion he
thinks transferred the name of Oman to the
same part of the country. The climate of the incense
country is described as being extremely unhealthy,
but its unhealthiness seems to have been
designedly exaggerated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_33"></a>33. From the port of <em class="gesperrt">Moskha</em> onward to
<em class="gesperrt">Asikh</em>, a distance of about 1,500 stadia, runs
a range of hills pretty close to the shore, and at
its termination there are seven islands bearing
the name of <em class="gesperrt">Zenobios</em>, beyond which again
we come to another barbarous district not
subject to any power in Arabia, but to Persia.
If when sailing by this coast you stand well out
to sea so as to keep a direct course, then at
about a distance from the island of <em class="gesperrt">Zenobios</em>
of 2,000 stadia you arrive at another island,
called that of <em class="gesperrt">Sarapis</em>, lying off shore, say, 120
stadia. It is about 200 stadia broad and 600
long, possessing three villages inhabited by a
<i>savage</i> tribe of <em class="gesperrt">Ikhthyophagoi</em>, who speak
the Arabic language, and whose clothing
consists of a girdle made from the leaves of the
cocoa-palm. The island produces in great
plenty tortoise of excellent quality, and the
merchants of <em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em> accordingly fit out little
boats and cargo-ships to trade with it.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(33) Beyond <em class="gesperrt">Moskha</em> the coast is mountainous
as far as <em class="gesperrt">Asikh</em> and the islands of Zenobios—a
distance excessively estimated at 1,500
stadia. The mountains referred to are 5,000 feet in
height, and are those now called Subaha. <em class="gesperrt">Asikh</em> is
readily to be identified with the <em class="gesperrt">Hâsek</em> of Arabian
geographers. Edrisi (I. p. 54) says: “Thence
(from Marbat) to the town of Hâsek is a four
days’ journey and a two days’ sail. Before <em class="gesperrt">Hâsek</em>
are the two islands of <em class="gesperrt">Khartan</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Martan</em>.
Above <em class="gesperrt">Hâsek</em> is a high mountain named <em class="gesperrt">Sous</em>,
which commands the sea. It is an inconsiderable
town but populous.” This place is now in ruins,
but has left its name to the promontory on which
it stood [Râs Hâsek, lat. 17°&nbsp;23´ N. long. 55°&nbsp;20´
E. opposite the island of Hasiki]. The islands of
<em class="gesperrt">Zenobios</em> are mentioned by Ptolemy as seven in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
number, and are those called by Edrisi <em class="gesperrt">Khartan</em>
and <em class="gesperrt">Martan</em>, now known as the <em class="gesperrt">Kuriyân
Muriyân</em> islands. The inhabitants belonged to
an Arab tribe which was spread from Hâsek to
Râs-el-Ḥad, and was called <em class="gesperrt">Beit</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Beni Jenabi</em>,
whence the Greek name. M. Polo in the 31st
chapter of his travels “discourseth of the two
islands called Male and Female,” the position of
which he vaguely indicates by saying that “when
you leave the kingdom of <em class="gesperrt">Kesmacoran</em> (Mekran)
which is on the mainland, you go by sea
some 500 miles towards the south, and then you
find the 2 islands Male and Female lying about
30 miles distant from one another.” (See also
<i>Marco Polo</i>, vol. II. p. 396 note.)</p>

<p>Beyond <em class="gesperrt">Asikh</em> is a district inhabited by
barbarians, and subject not to Arabia but to Persis.
Then succeeds at a distance of 200 stadia beyond the
islands of <em class="gesperrt">Zenobios</em> the island of <em class="gesperrt">Sarapis</em>,
(the Ogyris of Pliny) now called Masira [lat. 20°
10´ to 20°&nbsp;42´ N., long. 58°&nbsp;37´ to 58°&nbsp;59´ E.] opposite
that part of the coast where Oman now begins.
The <i>Periplûs</i> exaggerates both its breadth and its
distance from the continent. It was still
inhabited by a tribe of fish-eaters in the time of
Ebn Batuta, by whom it was visited.</p>

<p>On proceeding from <em class="gesperrt">Sarapis</em> the adjacent
coast bends round, and the direction of the voyage

the south-eastern extremity of Arabia called <em class="gesperrt">Ras-el-Had</em>
[lat. 22°&nbsp;33´ N. long. 59°&nbsp;48´ E.] is here
indicated, but without being named; Ptolemy
calls it <em class="gesperrt">Korodamon</em> (VI. vii. 11.)</p>

<p><a id="para_34"></a>34. If sailing onward you wind round with
the adjacent coast to the north, then as you
approach the entrance of the Persian Gulf you
fall in with a group of islands which lie in a
range along the coast for 2,000 stadia, and are
called the islands of <em class="gesperrt">Kalaiou</em>. The inhabitants
of the adjacent coast are cruel and
treacherous, and see imperfectly in the daytime.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(34) Beyond it, and near the entrance to the
Persian Gulf, occurs, according to the <i>Periplûs</i>, a
group of many islands, which lie in a range along
the coast over a space of 2,000 stadia, and are
called the islands of <em class="gesperrt">Kalaiou</em>. Here our author
is obviously in error, for there are but three groups
of islands on this coast, which are not by any
means near the entrance of the Gulf. They lie
beyond Maskat [lat. 23°&nbsp;38´ N. long. 58°&nbsp;36´ E.] and
extend for a considerable distance along the
Batinah coast. The central group is that of the
Deymâniyeh islands (probably the Damnia of
Pliny) which are seven in number, and lie nearly
opposite Birkeh [lat 23°&nbsp;42´ N. long. 57°&nbsp;55´ E.].
The error, as Müller suggests, may be accounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
for by supposing that the tract of country called
El Baṭinah was mistaken for islands. This tract,
which is very low and extremely fertile, stretches
from Birkeh [lat. 23°&nbsp;42´ N. long. 57°&nbsp;55´ E.]
onward to Jibba, where high mountains approach
the very shore, and run on in an unbroken chain
to the mouth of the Persian Gulf. The islands
are not mentioned by any other author, for the
<em class="gesperrt">Calacou insulae</em> of Pliny (VI. xxxii. 150)
must, to avoid utter confusion, be referred to the
coast of the Arabian Gulf. There is a place called
<em class="gesperrt">El Kilat</em>, the Akilla of Pliny [lat. 22°&nbsp;40´ N.
long. 59°&nbsp;24´ E.]—but whether this is connected with
the <em class="gesperrt">Kalaiou</em> islands of the <i>Periplûs</i> is uncertain
[Conf. <i>Ind. Ant.</i> vol. IV. p. 48. El Kilhat, south
of Maskat and close to Ṣûr, was once a great
port.]</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_35"></a>35. Near the last headland of the islands of
<em class="gesperrt">Kalaiou</em> is the mountain called <em class="gesperrt">Kalon</em>
(Pulcher),<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> to which succeeds, at no great
distance, the mouth of the Persian Gulf,
where there are very many pearl fisheries.
On the left of the entrance, towering to a
vast height, are the mountains which bear
the name of <em class="gesperrt">Asaboi</em>, and directly opposite
on the right you see another mountain high and
round, called the hill of <em class="gesperrt">Semiramis</em>. The
strait which separates them has a width of
600 stadia, and through this opening the Persian
Gulf pours its vast expanse of waters far up
into the interior. At the very head of this gulf
there is a regular mart of commerce, called the
city of <em class="gesperrt">Apologos</em>, situate near <em class="gesperrt">Pasinou-Kharax</em>
and the river Euphrates.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(35) Before the mouth of the Persian Gulf is
reached occurs a height called <em class="gesperrt">Kalon</em> (Fair Mount)
at the last head of the islands of Papias—τῶν Παπίου νήσων.
This reading has been altered by
Fabricius and Schwanbeck to των Καλαιου νησων.
The Fair Mount, according to Vincent,
would answer sufficiently to Cape Fillam, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
that be high land, and not far from Fillam are
the straits. The great cape which Arabia
protrudes at these straits towards Karmania is
now called Ras Mussendom. It was seen from the
opposite coast by the expedition under Nearkhos,
to whom it appeared to be a day’s sail distant.
The height on that coast is called Semiramis, and
also Strongylê from its round shape. Mussendom,
the ‘Asabôn akron’ of Ptolemy, Vincent says,
“is a sort of Lizard Point to the Gulf; for all the
Arabian ships take their departure from it with
some ceremonies of superstition, imploring a blessing
on their voyage, and setting afloat a toy
like a vessel rigged and decorated, which if it is
dashed to pieces by the rocks is to be accepted by
the ocean as an offering for the escape of the vessel.”
[The straits between the island of Mussendom
and the mainland are called El Bab, and this is
the origin of the name of the Papiæ islands.—Miles’
<i>Jour. R. A. Soc.</i> N. S. vol. x. p. 168.]</p>

<p>The actual width of the straits is 40 miles.
Pliny gives it at 50, and the <i>Periplûs</i> at 75. Cape
Mussendom is represented in the <i>Periplûs</i> as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Ptolemy by the Mountains of the Asabi which
are described as tremendous heights, black, grim,
and abrupt. They are named from the tribe of
<em class="gesperrt">Beni Asab</em>.</p>

<p>We enter now the Gulf itself, and here the <i>Periplûs</i>
mentions only two particulars: the famous
Pearl Fisheries which begin at the straits and
extend to Bahrein, and the situation of a regular
trading mart called <em class="gesperrt">Apologos</em>, which lies at
the very head of the Gulf on the Euphrates, and in
the vicinity of <em class="gesperrt">Spasinou Kharax</em>. This
place does not appear to be referred to in any
other classical work, but it is frequently
mentioned by Arabian writers under the name of
Oboleh or Obolegh. As an emporium it took
the place of <em class="gesperrt">Terêdôn</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Diridôtis</em>, just as
<em class="gesperrt">Basra</em> (below which it was situated) under the
second Khaliphate took the place of <em class="gesperrt">Oboleh</em>
itself. According to Vincent, Oboleh, or a village
that represents it, still exists between Basra and the
Euphrates. The canal also is called the canal of
Oboleh. <em class="gesperrt">Kharax Pasinou</em> was situated where
the <em class="gesperrt">Karûn</em> (the <em class="gesperrt">Eulæus</em> of the ancients)
flows into the <em class="gesperrt">Pasitigris</em>, and is represented
by the modern trading town <em class="gesperrt">Muhammarah</em>.
It was founded by Alexander the Great, and after its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
destruction, was rebuilt by Antiokhos Epiphanes,
who changed its name from Alexandreia to Antiokheia.
It was afterwards occupied by an Arab
Chief called Pasines, or rather <em class="gesperrt">Spasines</em>, who
gave it the name by which it is best known. Pliny
states that the original town was only 10 miles
from the sea, but that in his time the existing
place was so much as 120 miles from it. It was
the birth-place of two eminent geographers—Dionysius
Periegetes and Isidôros.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_36"></a>36. If you coast along the mouth of the
gulf you are conducted by a six days’ voyage to
another seat of trade belonging to Persia, called
<em class="gesperrt">Omana</em>.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Barugaza maintains a regular
commercial intercourse with both these Persian
ports, despatching thither large vessels freighted
with copper, sandalwood, beams for rafters,
horn, and logs of sasamina and ebony. Omana
imports also frankincense from Kanê, while it
exports to Arabia a particular species of vessels
called <i>madara</i>, which have their planks sewn
together. But both from <em class="gesperrt">Apologos</em> and
<em class="gesperrt">Omana</em> there are exported to Barugaza and
to Arabia great quantities of pearl, of mean
quality however compared with the Indian sort,
together with purple, cloth for the natives,
wine, dates in great quantity, and gold and
slaves.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(36) After this cursory glance at the great
gulf, our author returns to the straits, and at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
conducts us to the Eastern shores of the æErythræan,
where occurs another emporium belonging
to Persis, at a distance from the straits of 6
courses or 3,000 stadia. This is Omana. It is
mentioned by Pliny (VI. xxxii. 149) who makes it
belong to Arabia, and accuses preceding writers
for placing it in Karmania.</p>

<p>The name of <em class="gesperrt">Omana</em> has been corrupted in
the MSS. of Ptolemy into Nommana, Nombana,
<em class="gesperrt">Kommana</em>, Kombana, but Marcian has preserved
the correct spelling. From Omana as from
Apologos great quantities of pearl of an inferior
sort were exported to Arabia and Barugaza. No
part however of the produce of India is mentioned
as among its exports, although it was the centre
of commerce between that country and Arabia.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_37"></a>37. After leaving the district of <em class="gesperrt">Omana</em>
the country of the <em class="gesperrt">Parsidai</em> succeeds, which
belongs to another government, and the bay
which bears the name of <em class="gesperrt">Terabdoi</em>, from the
midst of which a cape projects. Here also is
a river large enough to permit the entrance of
ships, with a small mart at its mouth called
<em class="gesperrt">Oraia</em>. Behind it in the interior, at the
distance of a seven days’ journey from the coast,
is the city where the king resides, called Rhambakia.
This district, in addition to corn, produces
wine, rice, and dates, though in the tract
near the sea, only the fragrant gum called
bdellium.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(37) The district which succeeds Omana belongs
to the <em class="gesperrt">Parsidai</em>, a tribe in Gedrosia next neigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>bours
to the <em class="gesperrt">Arbitae</em> on the East. They are
mentioned by Ptolemy (VI. xx., p. 439) and by
Arrian (<i>Indika</i> xxvi.) who calls them <em class="gesperrt">Pasirees</em>,
and notes that they had a small town
called <em class="gesperrt">Pasira</em>, distant about 60 stadia from the
sea, and a harbour with good anchorage called
<em class="gesperrt">Bagisara</em>. The Promontory of the <i>Periplûs</i> is
also noted and described as projecting far into the
sea, and being high and precipitous. It is the Cape
now called <em class="gesperrt">Arabah</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Urmarah</em>. The Bay
into which it projects is called <em class="gesperrt">Terabdôn</em>, a
name which is found only in our author.
Vincent erroneously identifies this with the <em class="gesperrt">Paragôn</em>
of Ptolemy. It is no doubt the Bay which
extends from Cape Guadel to Cape Monze. The
river which enters this Bay, at the mouth of which
stood the small mart called <em class="gesperrt">Oraia</em>, was probably
that which is now called the Akbor. The royal city
which lay inland from the sea a seven days’ journey
was perhaps, as Mannert has conjectured,
<em class="gesperrt">Rambakia</em>, mentioned by Arrian (<i>Anab.</i> vi. 21)
as the capital of the <em class="gesperrt">Oreitai</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Horitai</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="para_38"></a>38. After this region, where the coast is
already deeply indented by gulfs caused by the
land advancing with a vast curve from the east,
succeeds the seaboard of Skythia, a region
which extends to northward. It is very
low and flat, and contains the mouths of the
<em class="gesperrt">Sinthos</em> (Indus), the largest of all the rivers
which fall into the Erythræan Sea, and which,
indeed, pours into it such a vast body of water
that while you are yet far off from the land at
its mouth you find the sea turned of a white
colour by its waters.</p>

<p>The sign by which voyagers before sighting
land know that it is near is their meeting with
serpents floating on the water; but higher up
and on the coasts of Persia the first sign of land
is seeing them of a different kind, called <i>graai</i>.
[Sansk. <i>graha</i>—an alligator.] The river has seven
mouths, all shallow, marshy and unfit for navigation
except only the middle stream, on which
is <em class="gesperrt">Barbarikon</em>, a trading seaport. Before
this town lies a small islet, and behind it in the
interior is <em class="gesperrt">Minnagar</em>, the metropolis of
Skythia, which is governed, however, by Parthian
princes, who are perpetually at strife among
themselves, expelling each the other.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(38) We now approach the mouths of the
Indus which our author calls the <em class="gesperrt">Sinthos</em>, transliterating
the native name of it—<em class="gesperrt">Sindhu</em>. In
his time the wide tract which was watered by this
river in the lower part of its course was called
<em class="gesperrt">Indoskythia</em>. It derived its name from the
Skythian tribes (the <em class="gesperrt">Śâka</em> of Sansk.) who after
the overthrow of the Graeco-Baktrian empire
gradually passed southward to the coast, where
they established themselves about the year 120
<span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, occupying all the region between the Indus
and the Narmadâ. They are called by Dionysios
Periegetes <em class="gesperrt">Notioi Skythai</em>, the Southern
Skythians. Our author mentions two cities which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
belonged to them—<em class="gesperrt">Barbarikon</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Minnagar</em>;
the former of which was an emporium
situated near the sea on the middle and only navigable
branch of the Indus. Ptolemy has a <em class="gesperrt">Barbarei</em>
in the Delta, but the position he assigns
to it, does not correspond with that of <em class="gesperrt">Barbarikon</em>.
<em class="gesperrt">Minnagar</em> was the Skythian metropolis.
It lay inland, on or near the banks of the Indus.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_39"></a>39. Ships accordingly anchor near <em class="gesperrt">Barbarikê</em>,
but all their cargoes are conveyed by the
river up to the king, who resides in the metropolis.</p>

<p>The articles imported into this emporium are—Ἱματισμὸς
ἁπλους ἱκανὸς—Clothing, plain and
in considerable quantity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Ἱματισμὸς νόθος οὐ πολὺς—Clothing, mixed, not
much.</p>

<p>Πολύμιτα—Flowered cottons.</p>

<p>Χρυσόλιθον—Yellow-stone, topazes.</p>

<p>Κοράλλιον—Coral.</p>

<p>Αργυρώματα—Silver plate.</p>

<p>Χρῆμα—Specie.</p>

<p>Οἰνος οὐ πολύς—Wine, but not much.</p>

<p>The exports are:—</p>

<p>Κόστος—Costus, a spice.</p>

<p>Βδέλλα—Bdellium, a gum.</p>

<p>Λύκιον—A yellow dye (<i>Ruzot</i>).</p>

<p>Σηρικὰ δέρματα—Furs from China.</p>

<p>Ὀθόνιον—Cottons.</p>

<p>Νῆμα Σηρικὸν—Silk thread.</p>

<p>Ἰνδικὸν μέλαν—Indigo.</p>

<p>Ships destined for this port put out to sea
when the Indian monsoon prevails—that is,
about the month of July or Epiphi. The
voyage at this season is attended with danger,
but being shorter is more expeditious.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(39) Ships did not go up to it but remained at
<em class="gesperrt">Barbarikon</em>, their cargoes being conveyed up
the river in small boats. In Ptolemy (VII. i. 61)
the form of the name is <em class="gesperrt">Binagara</em>, which is less
correct since the word is composed of <i>Min</i>, the
Indian name for the Skythians, and <i>nagar</i>, a city.
Ritter considers that <em class="gesperrt">Ṭhaṭha</em> is its modern representative,
since it is called <em class="gesperrt">Saminagar</em> by
the Jâḍejâ Rajputs who, though settled in Kachh,
derive their origin from that city. To this view
it is objected that Ṭhaṭha is not near the position
which Ptolemy assigns to his <em class="gesperrt">Binagara</em>. Mannert
places it at <em class="gesperrt">Bakkar</em>, D’Anville at <em class="gesperrt">Mansura</em>,
and Vincent at <em class="gesperrt">Menhabery</em> mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
by Edrisi (I. p. 164) as distant two stations or 60
miles from <em class="gesperrt">Dabil</em>, which again was three stations
or 90 miles from the mouth of the Indus, that is
it lay at the head of the Delta. Our author informs
us that in his time <em class="gesperrt">Minagar</em> was ruled by
Parthian princes. The Parthians (the Parada of
Sanskrit writers) must therefore have subverted
a Skythian dynasty which must have been that
which (as Benfey has shown) was founded by
<em class="gesperrt">Yeukaotschin</em> between the years 30 and 20
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, or about 30 years only after the famous Indian
Æra called <i>Śâkâbda</i> (the year of the Śâka) being
that in which Vikramâditya expelled the Skythians
from Indian soil. The statement of the <i>Periplûs</i>
that Parthian rulers succeeded the Skythian is
confirmed by Parthian coins found everywhere
in this part of the country. These sovereigns
must have been of consequence, or the trade
of their country very lucrative to the merchant
as appears by the presents necessary to ensure his
protection—plate, musical instruments, handsome
girls for the Harem, the best wine, plain cloth of
high price, and the finest perfumes. The profits
of the trade must therefore have been great, but if
Pliny’s account be true, that every pound laid out
in India produced a hundred at Rome, greater
exactions than these might easily have been supported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_40"></a>40. After the river <em class="gesperrt">Sinthos</em> is passed we
reach another gulf, which cannot be easily seen.
It has two divisions,—the Great and the Little
by name,—both shoal with violent and continuous
eddies extending far out from the shore, so that
before ever land is in sight ships are often
grounded on the shoals, or being caught within
the eddies are lost. Over this gulf hangs a
promontory which, curving from <em class="gesperrt">Eirinon</em> first
to the east, then to the south, and finally to the
west, encompasses the gulf called <em class="gesperrt">Barakê</em>,
in the bosom of which lie seven islands.
Should a vessel approach the entrance of
this gulf, the only chance of escape for those on
board is at once to alter their course and stand
out to sea, for it is all over with them if they
are once fairly within the womb of <em class="gesperrt">Barakê</em>,
which surges with vast and mighty billows,
and where the sea, tossing in violent commotion,
forms eddies and impetuous whirlpools in every
direction. The bottom varies, presenting in
places sudden shoals, in others being scabrous
with jagged rocks, so that when an anchor
grounds its cable is either at once cut through,
or soon broken by friction at the bottom. The
sign by which voyagers know they are approaching
this bay is their seeing serpents floating
about on the water, of extraordinary size and of
a black colour, for those met with lower down
and in the neighbourhood of Barugaza are of
less size, and in colour green and golden.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(40) The first place mentioned after the Indus
is the Gulf of <em class="gesperrt">Eirinon</em>, a name of which traces
remain in the modern appellation the <em class="gesperrt">Raṇ</em> of
Kachh. This is no longer covered with water
except during the monsoon, when it is flooded by
sea water or by rains and inundated rivers. At
other seasons it is not even a marsh, for its bed is
hard, dry and sandy; a mere saline waste almost
entirely devoid of herbage, and frequented but by
one quadruped—the wild ass. Burnes conjectured
that its desiccation resulted from an upheaval
of the earth caused by one of those earthquakes
which are so common in that part of India.
The <em class="gesperrt">Raṇ</em> is connected with the Gulf of Kachh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
which our author calls the Gulf of <em class="gesperrt">Barakê</em>.
His account of it is far from clear. Perhaps, as
Müller suggests, he comprehended under <em class="gesperrt">Eirinon</em>
the interior portion of the Gulf of Kachh,
limiting the Gulf of <em class="gesperrt">Barakê</em> to the exterior portion
or entrance to it. This gulf is called that of
Kanthi by Ptolemy, who mentions <em class="gesperrt">Barakê</em> only
as an island, [and the south coast of Kachh is
still known by the name of Kantha]. The islands
of the <i>Periplûs</i> extend westward from the neighbourhood
of <em class="gesperrt">Navanagar</em> to the very entrance
of the Gulf.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_41"></a>41. To the gulf of <em class="gesperrt">Barakê</em> succeeds that
of <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em> and the mainland of <em class="gesperrt">Ariakê</em>,
a district which forms the frontier of the kingdom
of <em class="gesperrt">Mombaros</em> and of all India. The
interior part of it which borders on <em class="gesperrt">Skythia</em>
is called <em class="gesperrt">Aberia</em>, and its sea-board <em class="gesperrt">Surastrênê</em>.
It is a region which produces abundantly
corn and rice and the oil of sesamum,
butter, muslins and the coarser fabrics which are
manufactured from Indian cotton. It has also
numerous herds of cattle. The natives are men
of large stature and coloured black. The metropolis
of the district is <em class="gesperrt">Minnagar</em>, from which
cotton cloth is exported in great quantity to
<em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em>. In this part of the country there
are preserved even to this very day memorials
of the expedition of Alexander, old temples,
foundations of camps, and large wells. The
extent of this coast, reckoned from <em class="gesperrt">Barbarikon</em>
to the promontory called <em class="gesperrt">Papikê</em>, near
<em class="gesperrt">Astakapra</em>, which is opposite <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em>,
is 3,000 stadia.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(41) To <em class="gesperrt">Barakê</em> succeeds the Gulf of <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em>
(Gulf of <em class="gesperrt">Khambhât</em>) and the sea-board
of the region called <em class="gesperrt">Ariakê</em>. The reading of the
MS. here ἡ πρἡὸς Ἀραβικῆς χώρας is considered corrupt.
Müller substitutes <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>ἡ ἤπειρος τῆς Ἀριακῆς χώρας,
though Mannert and others prefer Λαρικῆς χώρας,
relying on Ptolemy, who places <em class="gesperrt">Ariakê</em> to
the south of <em class="gesperrt">Larikê</em>, and says that <em class="gesperrt">Larikê</em>
comprehends the peninsula (of Gujarât) Barugaza
and the parts adjacent. As <em class="gesperrt">Ariakê</em> was however
previously mentioned in the <i>Periplûs</i> (sec.
14) in connexion with Barugaza, and is afterwards
mentioned (sec. 54) as trading with Muziris, it
must no doubt have been mentioned by the author
in its proper place, which is here. [Bhagvanlâl
Indraji Pandit has shewn reasons however for
correcting the readings into Αβαρατικη, the Prakrit
form of <em class="gesperrt">Aparântikâ</em>, an old name of the western
sea board of India.—<i>Ind. Ant.</i> vol. VII., pp. 259,
263.] Regarding the name <em class="gesperrt">Larikê</em>, Yule has
the following note (<i>Travels of M. Polo</i> vol. II.,
p. 353):—“<em class="gesperrt">Lâr-Deśa</em>, the country of Lar,” properly
Lât-deśa, was an early name for the
territory of Gujrat and the northern Konkan,
embracing Saimur (the modern Chaul as I believe)
Thaṇa, and Bharoch. It appears in Ptolemy in
the form <em class="gesperrt">Larikê</em>. The sea to the west of that coast
was in the early Muhammadan times called the sea
of Lâr, and the language spoken on its shores is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
called by <em class="gesperrt">Mas’udi</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Lâri</em>. Abulfeda’s authority,
Ibn Said, speaks of Lâr and Gujarât as identical.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Ariakê</em> (Aparântikâ), our author informs us,
was the beginning or frontier of India. That part
of the interior of Ariakê which bordered on Skythia
was called <em class="gesperrt">Aberia</em> or Abiria (in the MS. erroneously
Ibêria). The corresponding Indian word
is <em class="gesperrt">Abhira</em>, which designated the district near
the mouths of the river. Having been even in
very early times a great seat of commerce, some
(as Lassen) have been led to think from a certain
similarity of the names that this was the <em class="gesperrt">Ophir</em>
of scripture, a view opposed by Ritter. Abiria is
mentioned by Ptolemy, who took it to be not a part
of India but of Indoskythia. The sea-board of
Ariakê was called <em class="gesperrt">Surastrênê</em>, and is mentioned
by Ptolemy, who says (VII. i. 55) it was the region
about the mouths of the Indus and the Gulf of
Kanthi. It answers to the Sanskrit <em class="gesperrt">Surâshṭra</em>.
Its capital was Minnagar,—a city which,
as its name shows, had once belonged to the Min
or Skythians. It was different of course from the
Minnagar already mentioned as the capital of Indo-Skythia.
It was situated to the south of <em class="gesperrt">Ozênê</em>
(Ujjayinî, or Ujjain), and on the road which led from
that city to the River Narmadâ, probably near
where Indôr now stands. It must have been the
capital only for a short time, as Ptolemy informs
us (II. i. 63) that <em class="gesperrt">Ozênê</em> was in his time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
capital of <em class="gesperrt">Tiashanes</em> [probably the Chashṭana
of Coins and the Cave Temple inscriptions]. From
both places a great variety of merchandise was
sent down the Narmadâ to Barugaza.</p>

<p>The next place our author mentions is a promontory
called <em class="gesperrt">Papikê</em> projecting into the Gulf
of Khambât from that part of the peninsula of
Gujarât which lies opposite to the Barugaza coast.
Its distance from Barbarikon on the middle mouth
of the Indus is correctly given at 3,000 stadia.
This promontory is said to be near <em class="gesperrt">Astakapra</em>,
a place which is mentioned also by Ptolemy, and
which (<i>Ind. Ant.</i> vol. V. p. 314) has been identified by
Colonel Yule with <em class="gesperrt">Hastakavapra</em> (now <em class="gesperrt">Hâthab</em>
near Bhaunagar), a name which occurs in
a copper-plate grant of Dhruvasena I of Valabhi.
With regard to the Greek form of this name
Dr. Bühler thinks it is not derived immediately
from the Sanskrit, but from an intermediate old
Prakrit word Hastakampra, which had been
formed by the contraction of the syllables <i>ava</i>
to <i>â</i>, and the insertion of a nasal, according to
the habits of the Gujarâtîs. The loss of the
initial, he adds, may be explained by the difficulty
which Gujarâtîs have now and probably had 1,600
years ago in pronouncing the spirans in its proper
place. The modern name Hâthab or Hâthap may
be a corruption of the shorter Sanskrit form
Hastavapra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_42"></a>42. After Papikê there is another gulf,
exposed to the violence of the waves and
running up to the north. Near its mouth is an
island called <em class="gesperrt">Baiônês</em>, and at its very head it
receives a vast river called the <em class="gesperrt">Mais</em>. Those
bound for <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em> sail up this gulf (which
has a breadth of about 300 stadia), leaving the
island on the left till it is scarcely visible in the
horizon, when they shape their course east for
the mouth of the river that leads to Barugaza.
This is called the <em class="gesperrt">Namnadios</em>.</p>



<blockquote>

<p>(42) Beyond <em class="gesperrt">Papikê</em>, we are next informed,
there is another gulf running northward into the
interior of the country. This is not really another
Gulf but only the northern portion of the Gulf
of Khambât, which the <i>Periplûs</i> calls the Gulf of
Barugaza. It receives a great river, the <em class="gesperrt">Mais</em>,
which is easily identified with the <em class="gesperrt">Mahi</em>, and
contains an island called <em class="gesperrt">Baiônês</em> [the modern
Peram], which you leave on the left hand as you
cross over from Astakapra to Barugaza.</p>

<p>We are now conducted to <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em>, the
greatest seat of commerce in Western India,
situated on a river called in the MS. of the <i>Periplûs</i>
the <em class="gesperrt">Lamnaios</em>, which is no doubt an erroneous
reading for <em class="gesperrt">Namados</em>, or Namnados or Namnadios.
This river is the <em class="gesperrt">Narmadâ</em>. It is called
by Ptolemy the Namades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_43"></a>43. The passage into the gulf of <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em>
is narrow and difficult of access to those
approaching it from the sea, for they are carried
either to the right or to the left, the left being
the better passage of the two. On the right,
at the very entrance of the gulf, lies a narrow
stripe of shoal, rough and beset with rocks. It
is called <em class="gesperrt">Herônê</em>, and lies opposite the village
of <em class="gesperrt">Kammôni</em>. On the left side right against
this is the promontory of <em class="gesperrt">Papikê</em>, which lies
in front of <em class="gesperrt">Astakapra</em>, where it is difficult to
anchor, from the strength of the current and
because the cables are cut through by the sharp
rocks at the bottom. But even if the passage
into the gulf is secured the mouth of the
Barugaza river is not easy to hit, since the coast
is low and there are no certain marks to be seen
until you are close upon them. Neither, if it is
discovered, is it easy to enter, from the presence
of shoals at the mouth of the river.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(43) <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em> (Bharoch) which was 30
miles distant from its mouth, was both difficult and
dangerous of access; for the entrance to the Gulf
itself was, on the right, beset with a perilous stripe
(<i>tainia</i>) of rocky shoal called <em class="gesperrt">Herônê</em>, and on the
left, (which was the safer course,) the violent
currents which swept round the promontory of
Papikê rendered it unsafe to approach the shore or
to cast anchor. The shoal of Herônê was opposite
a village on the mainland called <em class="gesperrt">Kammôni</em>,
the Kamanê of Ptolemy (VII. i.), who however
places it to the north of the river’s mouth. Again,
it was not only difficult to hit the mouth of
the river, but its navigation was endangered by
sandbanks and the violence of the tides, especially
the high tide called the ‘Bore,’ of which our author
gives a description so particular and so vivid as
suffices to show that he was describing what he
had seen with his own eyes, and seen moreover
for the first time. With regard to the name
<em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em> the following passage, which I quote
from Dr. Wilson’s <i>Indian Castes</i> (vol. II. p. 113) will
elucidate its etymology:—“The <em class="gesperrt">Bhârgavas</em>
derive their designation from <em class="gesperrt">Bhargava</em>, the
adjective form of <em class="gesperrt">Bhṛigu</em>, the name of one of
the ancient Ṛishis. Their chief habitat is the district
of Bharoch, which must have got its name from
a colony of the school of Bhṛigu having been early
established in this Kshêtra, probably granted to
them by some conqueror of the district. In the
name <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em> given to it by Ptolemy, we have
a Greek corruption of Bhṛigukshêtra (the territory
of Bhṛigu) or Bhṛigukachha (the tongueland of
Bhṛigu).” Speaking of the Bhârgavas Dr. Drummond,
in his <i>Grammatical Illustrations</i>, says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>—“These
Brâhmans are indeed poor and ignorant.
Many of them, and other illiterate Gujarâtîs,
would, in attempting to articulate Bhṛigushêtra,
lose the half in coalesence, and call it Bargacha,
whence the Greeks, having no <i>Ch</i>, wrote it Barugaza.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_44"></a>44. For this reason native fishermen appointed
by Government are stationed with well-manned
long boats called <i>trappaga</i> and <i>kotumba</i>
at the entrance of the river, whence they go out
as far as <em class="gesperrt">Surastrênê</em> to meet ships, and pilot
them up to Barugaza. At the head of the gulf
the pilot, immediately on taking charge of a ship,
with the help of his own boat’s crew, shifts her
head to keep her clear of the shoals, and tows
her from one fixed station to another, moving
with the beginning of the tide, and dropping
anchor at certain roadsteads and basins when it
ebbs. These basins occur at points where the
river is deeper than usual, all the way up to
<em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em>, which is 300 stadia distant from
the mouth of the river if you sail up the
stream to reach it.</p>

<p>45. India has everywhere a great abundance
of rivers, and her seas ebb and flow with tides
of extraordinary strength, which increase with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the moon, both when new and when full, and
for three days after each, but fall off in the
intermediate space. About <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em> they
are more violent than elsewhere; so that all of
a sudden you see the depths laid bare, and
portions of the land turned into sea, and the
sea, where ships were sailing but just before,
turned without warning into dry land. The
rivers, again, on the access of flood tide rushing
into their channels with the whole body of the
sea, are driven upwards against their natural
course for a great number of miles with a force
that is irresistible.</p>

<p>46. This is the reason why ships frequenting
this emporium are exposed, both in coming
and going, to great risk, if handled by those who
are unacquainted with the navigation of the
gulf or visit it for the first time, since the impetuosity
of the tide when it becomes full, having
nothing to stem or slacken it, is such that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
anchors cannot hold against it. Large vessels,
moreover, if caught in it are driven athwart from
their course by the rapidity of the current till
they are stranded on shoals and wrecked, while
the smaller craft are capsized, and many that
have taken refuge in the side channels, being
left dry by the receding tide, turn over on
one side, and, if not set erect on props, are
filled upon the return of the tide with the very
first head of the flood, and sunk. But at new
moons, especially when they occur in conjunction
with a night tide, the flood sets in with such
extraordinary violence that on its beginning to
advance, even though the sea be calm, its roar is
heard by those living near the river’s mouth,
sounding like the tumult of battle heard far off,
and soon after the sea with its hissing waves
bursts over the bare shoals.</p>

<p>47. Inland from <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em> the country is
inhabited by numerous races—the <em class="gesperrt">Aratrioi</em>,
and the <em class="gesperrt">Arakhosioi</em>, and the <em class="gesperrt">Gandaraioi</em>,
and the people of <em class="gesperrt">Proklaïs</em>, in which is
<em class="gesperrt">Boukephalos Alexandreia</em>. Beyond
these are the <em class="gesperrt">Baktrianoi</em>, a most warlike
race, governed by their own independent sovereign.
It was from these parts Alexander issued
to invade India when he marched as far as the
Ganges, without, however, attacking Limurikê
and the southern parts of the country. Hence
up to the present day old <i>drachmai</i> bearing the
Greek inscriptions of <em class="gesperrt">Apollodotos</em> and
<em class="gesperrt">Menander</em> are current in Barugaza.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>(47) The account of the ‘bore’ is followed by an
enumeration of the countries around and beyond
Barugaza with which it had commercial relations.
Inland are the <em class="gesperrt">Aratrioi</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Arakhosioi</em>,
<em class="gesperrt">Gandarioi</em> and the people of <em class="gesperrt">Proklaïs</em>, a
province wherein is Boukephalos Alexandreia,
beyond which is the Baktrian nation. It has
been thought by some that by the <em class="gesperrt">Aratrioi</em> are
meant the Arii, by others that they were the
<em class="gesperrt">Arâstrâs</em> of Sanskrit called Aratti in the
Prakrit, so that the <em class="gesperrt">Aratrioi</em> of the <i>Periplûs</i>
hold an intermediate place between the Sanskrit and
Prakrit form of the name. Müller however says
“if you want a people known to the Greeks and
Romans as familiarly as the well-known names
of the Arakhosii, Gandarii, Peukelitae, you may
conjecture that the proper reading is ΔΡΑΝΓΩΝ instead
of ΑΡΑΤΡΙΩΝ.” It is an error of course on the
part of our author when he places <em class="gesperrt">Boukephalos</em>
(a city built by Alexander on the banks of the
Hydaspês, where he defeated Pôros), in the neighbourhood
of Proklaïs, that is Pekhely in the neighbourhood
of Peshawar. He makes a still more
surprising error when he states that Alexander
penetrated to the Ganges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_48"></a>48. In the same region eastward is a city
called <em class="gesperrt">Ozênê</em>, formerly the capital wherein
the king resided. From it there is brought
down to Barugaza every commodity for the
supply of the country and for export to our
own markets—onyx-stones, porcelain, fine muslins,
mallow-coloured muslins, and no small
quantity of ordinary cottons. At the same time
there is brought down to it from the upper
country by way of <em class="gesperrt">Proklaïs</em>, for transmission
to the coast, Kattybourine, Patropapigic,
and Kabalitic spikenard, and another kind
which reaches it by way of the adjacent province
of Skythia; also kostus and bdellium.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(48) The next place mentioned in the enumeration
is <em class="gesperrt">Ozênê</em> (Ujjain), which, receiving
nard through Proklaïs from the distant regions
where it was produced, passed it on to the
coast for export to the Western World. This
aromatic was a product of three districts, whence
its varieties were called respectively the <i>Kattybourine</i>,
the <i>Patropapigic</i> and the <i>Kabolitic</i>. What
places were indicated by the first two names
cannot be ascertained, but the last points undoubtedly
to the region round Kâbul, since
its inhabitants are called by Ptolemy <em class="gesperrt">Kabolitai</em>,
and Edrisi uses the term <i>Myrobalanos Kabolinos</i>
for the ‘myrobolans of Kâbul.’ Nard, as Edrisi also
observes, has its proper soil in Thibet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_49"></a>49. The imports of <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em> are—</p>

<p>Οἶνος προηγουμένος Ἰταλικὸς—Wine, principally
Italian.</p>

<p>Καὶ Λαοδικηνὸς καὶ Ἀραβικὸς—Laodikean wine
and Arabian.</p>

<p>Χαλκος καὶ κασσίτερος καὶ μόλυβδος—Brass or
Copper and Tin and Lead.</p>

<p>Κοράλλιον καὶ χρυσόλιθον—Coral and Gold-stone
or Yellow-stone.</p>

<p>Ἱματισμὸς ἁπλοῦς καὶ νόθος πανταῖος—Cloth, plain
and mixed, of all sorts.</p>

<p>Πολύμιται ζῶναι πηχυαῖαι—Variegated sashes half
a yard wide.</p>

<p>Ὕαλος ἀργὴ—White glass.</p>

specie, yielding a profit when exchanged for native
money.</p>

<p>Μύρον οὐ βαρύτιμον ὀυδὲ πολὺ—Perfumes or unguents,
neither costly nor in great quantity.</p>

<p>In those times, moreover, there were imported,
<i>as presents</i> to the king, costly silver vases, instruments
of music, handsome young women for
concubinage, superior wine, apparel, plain but
costly, and the choicest unguents. The exports
from this part of the country are—</p>

<p>Νὺρδος, κόστος, βδέλλα, ελεφας—Spikenard, costus,
bdellium, ivory.</p>

<p>Ὀνυχίνη λιθία καὶ μουρρίνη—Onyx-stones and
porcelain.</p>

<p>Λύκιον—<i>Ruzot</i>, Box-thorn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>Μολόχινον—Mallow-coloured cottons.</p>

<p>Νῆμα—<i>Silk</i> thread.</p>

<p>Πέτερι μακρὸν—Long pepper and other articles
supplied from the neighbouring ports.</p>

<p>The proper season to set sail for Barugaza
from Egypt is the month of July, or Epiphi.</p>

<p>50. From <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em> the coast immediately
adjoining stretches from the north directly
to the south, and the country is therefore called
<em class="gesperrt">Dakhinabadês</em>, because Dakhan in the
language of the natives signifies <i>south</i>. Of this
country that part which lies inland towards the
east comprises a great space of desert country,
and large mountains abounding with all kinds
of wild animals, leopards, tigers, elephants, huge
snakes, hyenas, and baboons of many different
sorts, and is inhabited right across to the Ganges
by many and extremely populous nations.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(50) <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em> had at the same time commercial
relations with the Dekhan also. This part
of India our author calls <em class="gesperrt">Dakhinabadês</em>, transliterating
the word <em class="gesperrt">Dakshinâpatha</em>—(the
Dakshinâ, or the South Country). “Here,” says
Vincent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> “the author of the <i>Periplûs</i> gives the true
direction of this western coast of the Peninsula,
and states in direct terms its tendency to the
South, while Ptolemy stretches out the whole
angle to a straight line, and places the Gulf of
Cambay almost in the same latitude as Cape
Comorin.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_51"></a>51. Among the marts in this South Country
there are two of more particular importance—<em class="gesperrt">Paithana</em>,
which lies south from Barugaza,
a distance of twenty days, and <em class="gesperrt">Tagara</em>, ten
days east of Paithana, the greatest city in the
country. Their commodities are carried down
on wagons to Barugaza along roads of extreme
difficulty,—that is, from <em class="gesperrt">Paithana</em> a great
quantity of onyx-stone, and from <em class="gesperrt">Tagara</em>
ordinary cottons in abundance, many sorts of
muslins, mallow-coloured cottons, and other
articles of local production brought into it from
the parts along the coast. The length of the
entire voyage as far as <em class="gesperrt">Limurikê</em> is 700
stadia, and to reach <em class="gesperrt">Aigialos</em> you must sail
very many stadia further.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(51) In the interior of the Dekhan, the <i>Periplûs</i>
places two great seats of commerce, <em class="gesperrt">Paithana</em>,
20 days’ journey to the south of Barugaza, and
<em class="gesperrt">Tagara</em>, 10 days’ journey eastward from Paithana.
Paithana, which appears in Ptolemy as
Baithana, may be identified with <em class="gesperrt">Paithana</em>.
<em class="gesperrt">Tagara</em> is more puzzling. Wilford, Vincent,
Mannert, Ritter and others identify it with <em class="gesperrt">Dêvagiri</em>
or Deogarh, near Elurâ, about 8 miles from
Aurangâbâd. The name of a place called Tagarapura
occurs in a copper grant of land which was
found in the island of Salsette. There is however
nothing to show that this was a name of Dêvagiri.
Besides, if Paithana be correctly identified, Tagara
cannot be Dêvagiri unless the distances and directions
are very erroneously given in the <i>Periplûs</i>.
This is not improbable, and Tagara may therefore
be <em class="gesperrt">Junnar</em> (<i>i.e.</i> Jûna-nagar = <i>the old city</i>), which
from its position must always have been an emporium,
and its Buddha caves belong to about
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 100 to <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 150 (see <i>Archæolog. Surv. of West.
India</i>, vol. III., and Elphinstone’s <i>History of
India</i>, p. 223).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Our author introduces us next to another division
of India, that called <em class="gesperrt">Limurikê</em>, which
begins, as he informs us, at a distance of 7,000 stadia
(or nearly 900 miles) beyond Barugaza. This
estimate is wide of the mark, being in fact about
the distance between Barugaza and the southern
or remote extremity of Limurikê. In the Indian
segment of the Roman maps called from their discoverer,
the <i>Peutinger Tables</i>, the portion of India
to which this name is applied is called <em class="gesperrt">Damirike</em>.
We can scarcely err, says Dr. Caldwell
(<i>Dravid. Gram.</i> Intr. page 14), in identifying this
name with the Tami[l:] country. If so, the earliest
appearance of the name Tami[l:] in any foreign
documents will be found also to be most perfectly
in accordance with the native Tami[l:] mode of
spelling the name. <em class="gesperrt">Damirike</em> evidently means
<i>Damirike</i>.... In another place in the same map
a district is called <em class="gesperrt">Scytia Dymirice</em>; and it
appears to have been this word which by a mistake
of Δ for Λ Ptolemy wrote Λυμιρικὴ. The D
retains its place however in the Cosmography of
the anonymous geographer of Ravenna, who repeatedly
mentions <em class="gesperrt">Dimirica</em> as one of the three
divisions of India and the one furthest to the East.
He shows also that the Tami[l:] country must
have been meant by the name by mentioning
<em class="gesperrt">Modura</em> as one of the cities it contained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_52"></a>52. The local marts which occur in order
<i>along the coast</i> after <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em> are <em class="gesperrt">Akabarou</em>,
<em class="gesperrt">Souppara</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Kalliena</em>, a city which
was raised to the rank of a regular mart in the
times of the elder <em class="gesperrt">Saraganes</em>, but after
<em class="gesperrt">Sandanes</em> became its master its trade was
put under the severest restrictions; for if Greek
vessels, even by accident, enter its ports, a guard
is put on board and they are taken to Barugaza.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(52) Reverting to <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em> our author next
enumerates the less important emporia having
merely a local trade which intervenes between it
and <em class="gesperrt">Dimurikê</em>. Those are first <em class="gesperrt">Akabarou</em>,
<em class="gesperrt">Souppara</em>, and <em class="gesperrt">Kalliena</em>—followed by
<em class="gesperrt">Semulla</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Mandagora</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Palaipatmai</em>,
<em class="gesperrt">Meligeizara</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Buzantion</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Toperon</em>, and
<em class="gesperrt">Turanosboas</em>,—beyond which occurs a succession
of islands, some of which give shelter to
pirates, and of which the last is called <em class="gesperrt">Leukê</em> or
White Island. The actual distance from Barugaza
to Naoura, the first port of Dimurikê, is 4,500
stadia.</p>

<p>To take these emporia in detail. <em class="gesperrt">Akabarou</em>
cannot be identified. The reading is probably corrupt.
Between the mouths of the Namados and
those of the Goaris, Ptolemy interposes Nousaripa,
Poulipoula, Ariakê Sadinôn, and Soupara. <em class="gesperrt">Nausaripa</em>
is <em class="gesperrt">Nausari</em>, about 18 miles to the
south of Surat, and <em class="gesperrt">Soupara</em> is <em class="gesperrt">Sûpârâ</em> near
Vasâï. Benfey, who takes it to be the name of a
region and not of a city, regards it as the <em class="gesperrt">Ophir</em>
of the Bible—called in the Septuagint Σωφηρά.
<em class="gesperrt">Sôphir</em>, it may be added, is the Coptic name for
India. <em class="gesperrt">Kalliena</em> is now <em class="gesperrt">Kalyâna</em> near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Bombay [which must have been an important
place at an early date. It is named in the
Kaṇhêri Bauddha Cave Inscriptions]. It is
mentioned by Kosmas (p. 337), who states that
it produced copper and sesamum and other
kinds of logs, and cloth for wearing apparel.
The name <em class="gesperrt">Sandanes</em>, that of the Prince who
sent Greek ships which happened to put into its
port under guard to Barugaza, is thought by
Benfey to be a territorial title which indicated
that he ruled over <em class="gesperrt">Ariakê</em> of the Sandineis.
[But the older “Saraganes” probably indicates
one of the great Śâtakarṇi or Ândhrabhṛitya
dynasty.] Ptolemy does not mention Kalliena,
though he supplies the name of a place omitted
in the <i>Periplûs</i>, namely <em class="gesperrt">Dounga</em> (VII. i. 6)
near the mouth of the river <em class="gesperrt">Bênda</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_53"></a>53. After <em class="gesperrt">Kalliena</em> other local marts occur—<em class="gesperrt">Semulla</em>,
<em class="gesperrt">Mandagora</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Palaipatmai</em>,
<em class="gesperrt">Melizeigara</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Buzantion</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Toparon</em>,
and <em class="gesperrt">Turannosboas</em>. You come next to the
islands called <em class="gesperrt">Sêsekreienai</em> and the island
of the <em class="gesperrt">Aigidioi</em> and that of the <em class="gesperrt">Kaineitai</em>,
near what is called the <em class="gesperrt">Khersonêsos</em>, places
in which are pirates, and after this the island
<em class="gesperrt">Leukê</em> (or ‘the White’). Then follow <em class="gesperrt">Naoura</em>
and <em class="gesperrt">Tundis</em>, the first marts of <em class="gesperrt">Limurikê</em>,
and after these <em class="gesperrt">Mouziris</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Nelkunda</em>,
the seats of Government.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(53) <em class="gesperrt">Semulla</em> (in Ptolemy <em class="gesperrt">Timoula</em> and
<em class="gesperrt">Simulla</em>) is identified by Yule with <em class="gesperrt">Chênval</em>
or Chaul, a seaport 23 miles south of Bombay;
[but Bhagvanlâl Indraji suggests Chimûla in
Trombay island at the head of the Bombay
harbour; and this is curiously supported by one
of the Kanhêri inscriptions in which <em class="gesperrt">Chemûla</em>
is mentioned, apparently as a large city, like
Supârâ and Kalyâna, in the neighbourhood].
After Simulla Ptolemy mentions <em class="gesperrt">Hippokoura</em>
[possibly, as suggested by the same,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
a partial translation of <em class="gesperrt">Ghoḍabandar</em> on
the Choḍa nadi in the Ṭhaṅa strait] and <em class="gesperrt">Baltipatna</em>
as places still in Ariakê, but <em class="gesperrt">Mandagara
Buzanteion</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Khersonêsos</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Armagara</em>,
the mouths of the river <em class="gesperrt">Nanagouna</em>,
and an emporium called <em class="gesperrt">Nitra</em>, as belonging to
the Pirate Coast which extended to Dimurikê, of
which <em class="gesperrt">Tundis</em>, he says, is the first city. Ptolemy
therefore agrees with our author in assigning the
Pirate Coast to the tract of country between
Bombay and Goa. This coast continued to be
infested with pirates till so late a period as the
year 1765, when they were finally exterminated by
the British arms. <em class="gesperrt">Mandagara</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Palaipatma</em>
may have corresponded pretty nearly in situation
with the towns of Rájapur and Bankut. Yule
places them respectively at Bankut and Debal.
<em class="gesperrt">Melizeigara</em> (Milizêguris or Milizigêris of
Ptolemy, VII. i. 95), Vincent identifies with Jaygaḍh
or Sidê Jaygaḍh. The same place appears in Pliny
as <em class="gesperrt">Sigerus</em> (VI. xxvi. 100). Buzantium may be
referred to about Vijayadrug or Esvantgadh, <em class="gesperrt">Toparon</em>
may be a corrupt reading for <em class="gesperrt">Togaron</em>,
and may perhaps therefore be Devagaḍh which
lies a little beyond Vijayndrug. <em class="gesperrt">Turannosboas</em>
is not mentioned elsewhere, but it may have been,
us Yule suggests, the Bandâ or Tirakal river.
Müller placed it at Acharê. The first island on
this part of the coast is Sindhudrug near Mâlwan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
to which succeeds a group called the Burnt Islands,
among which the Vingorla rocks are conspicuous.
These are no doubt the <em class="gesperrt">Heptanêsia</em> of
Ptolemy (VII. i. 95), and probably the <em class="gesperrt">Sêsikrienai</em>
of the <i>Periplûs</i>. The island Aigidion
called that of the Aigidii may be placed at Goa,
[but Yule suggests Angediva south of Sadaśivagaḍh,
in lat. 14°&nbsp;45´ N., which is better]. Kaineiton
may be the island of St. George.</p>

<p>We come next to <em class="gesperrt">Naoura</em> in Dimurikê. This
is now <em class="gesperrt">Honâvar</em>, written otherwise Onore,
situated on the estuary of a broad river, the
<em class="gesperrt">Śarâvatî</em>, on which are the falls of Gêrsappa,
one of the most magnificent and stupendous
cataracts in the world. If the <em class="gesperrt">Nitra</em> of Ptolemy
(VII. i. 7) and the <em class="gesperrt">Nitria</em> of Pliny be the same as
<em class="gesperrt">Naoura</em>, then these authors extend the pirate
coast a little further south than the <i>Periplûs</i> does.
But if they do not, and therefore agree in their
views as to where Dimurikê begins, the <em class="gesperrt">Nitra</em>
may be placed, Müller thinks, at Mirjan or Komta,
which is not far north from Honâvar. [Yule
places it at Mangalur.] Müller regards the first
supposition however as the more probable, and
quotes at length a passage from Pliny (VI. xxvi.
104) referring thereto, which must have been excerpted
from some <i>Periplûs</i> like our author’s, but
not from it as some have thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> “To those
bound for India it is most convenient to depart
from Okêlis. They sail thence with the wind
Hipalus in 40 days to the first emporium of India,
Muziris, which is not a desirable place to arrive
at on account of pirates infesting the neighbourhood,
who hold a place called <em class="gesperrt">Nitrias</em>, while it is
not well supplied with merchandize. Besides,
the station for ships is at a great distance from
the shore, and cargoes have both to be landed and
to be shipped by means of little boats. There
reigned there when I wrote this <em class="gesperrt">Caelobothras</em>.
Another port belonging to the nation
is more convenient, <em class="gesperrt">Neacyndon</em>, which is
called <em class="gesperrt">Becare</em> (<i>sic. codd.</i>, Barace, Harduin and
Sillig). There reigned Pandiôn in an inland
town far distant from the emporium called <em class="gesperrt">Modura</em>.
The region, however, from which they
convey pepper to Becare in boats formed from
single logs is <em class="gesperrt">Cottonara</em>.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_54"></a>54. To the kingdom under the sway of
<em class="gesperrt">Kêprobotres<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Tundis</em> is subject, a village
of great note situate near the sea. <em class="gesperrt">Mouziris</em>,
which pertains to the same realm, is a city
at the height of prosperity, frequented as it
is by ships from <em class="gesperrt">Ariakê</em> and Greek ships <i>from
Egypt</i>. It lies near a river at a distance from
Tundis of 500 stadia, whether this is measured
from river to river or by the length of the sea
voyage, and it is 20 stadia distant from the
mouth of its own river. The distance of <em class="gesperrt">Nelkunda</em>
from <em class="gesperrt">Mouziris</em> also nearly 500
stadia, whether measured from river to river or
by the sea voyage, but it belongs to a different
kingdom, that of <em class="gesperrt">Pandiôn</em>. It likewise is
situate near a river and at about a distance
from the sea of 120 stadia.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(54) With regard to the names in this extract
which occur also in the <i>Periplûs</i> the following
passages quoted from Dr. Caldwell’s <i>Dravidian
Grammar</i> will throw much light. He says (Introd.
p. 97):—“<em class="gesperrt">Muziris</em> appears to be the <em class="gesperrt">Muyiri</em>
of Muyiri-kotta. Tyndis is <em class="gesperrt">Tuṇḍi</em>, and the
Kynda, of Nelkynda, or as Ptolemy has it, Melkynda,
<i>i. e.</i> probably Western kingdom, seems to
be <em class="gesperrt">Kannettri</em>, the southern boundary of Kêrala
proper. One MS. of Pliny writes the second part
of this word not <i>Cyndon</i> but <i>Canidon</i>. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
of these places was identified by Dr. Gundert, for
the remaining two we are indebted to Dr. Burnell.</p>

<p>“Cottonara, Pliny; Kottonarike, <i>Periplûs</i>, the
district where the best pepper was produced. It
is singular that this district was not mentioned
by Ptolemy. <em class="gesperrt">Cottonara</em> was evidently the
name of the district. κοττοναρικον the name of the
pepper for which the district was famous. Dr.
Buchanan identifies Cottonara with <em class="gesperrt">Kaḍatta-naḍu</em>,
the name of a district in the Calicut country
celebrated for its pepper. Dr. Burnell identifies it
with <em class="gesperrt">Koļatta-nâḍu</em>, the district about Tellicherry
which he says is the pepper district.
<i>Kadatta</i> in Malayâlam means ‘transport, conveyance,’
<em class="gesperrt">Nâdû</em>, Tam.—Mal., means a district.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>“The prince called Kêrobothros by Ptolemy (VII.
i. 86) is called Kêprobotros by the author of the
<i>Periplûs</i>. The insertion of π is clearly an error,
but more likely to be the error of a copyist than
that of the author, who himself had visited the
territories of the prince in question. He is called
Caelobothras in Pliny’s text, but one of the MSS.
gives it more correctly as Celobotras. The name
in Sanskrit, and in full is ‘Keralaputra,’ but both
<i>kêra</i> and <i>kêla</i> are Dravidian abbreviations of <i>kêralâ</i>.
They are Malayâļam however, not Tamil abbreviations,
and the district over which Keralaputra ruled
is that in which the Malayâļam language is now
spoken” (p. 95). From Ptolemy we learn that the
capital of this prince was <em class="gesperrt">Karoura</em>, which has
been “identified with <em class="gesperrt">Karûr</em>, an important town
in the Koimbatur district originally included in the
Chêra kingdom. Karûr means the black town....
Ptolemy’s word <em class="gesperrt">Karoura</em> represents the Tami[l:]
name of the place with perfect accuracy.” Nelkunda,
our author informs us, was not subject to
this prince but to another called <em class="gesperrt">Pandiôn</em>. This
name, says Dr. Caldwell, “is of Sanskrit origin,
and <em class="gesperrt">Pandæ</em>, the form which Pliny, after Megasthenês,
gives in his list of the Indian nations,
comes very near the Sanskrit. The more recent
local information of Pliny himself, as well as the
notices of Ptolemy and the <i>Periplûs</i>, supply us with
the Dravidian form of the word. The Tami[l:] sign
of the masc. sing. is <i>an</i>, and Tami[l:] inserts <i>i</i> euphonically
after <i>ṇḍ</i>, consequently Pandiôn, and still
better the plural form of the word <em class="gesperrt">Pandiones</em>,
faithfully represents the Tami[l:] masc. sing. <em class="gesperrt">Pâṇḍiyan</em>.”
In another passage the same scholar says:
“The Sanskrit Pâṇḍya is written in Tamil Pâṇḍiya,
but the more completely tamilized form <em class="gesperrt">Pâṇḍi</em>
is still more commonly used all over southern
India. I derive Pâṇḍi, as native scholars always
derive the word, from the Sanskrit Pâṇḍu, the
name of the father of the Pâṇḍava brothers.”
The capital of this prince, as Pliny has stated, was
<em class="gesperrt">Modura</em>, which is the Sanskrit Maṭhurâ pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>nounced
in the Tami[l:] manner. The corresponding
city in Northern India, Maṭhurâ, is written by the
Greeks <em class="gesperrt">Methora</em>.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">Nelkunda</em> is mentioned by various authors under
varying forms of the name. As has been already
stated, it is Melkunda in Ptolemy, who places it in
the country of the Aii. In the <i>Peutingerian Table</i>
it is Nincylda, and in the Geographer of Ravenna,
Nilcinna. At the mouth of the river on which
it stands was its shipping port <em class="gesperrt">Bakare</em> or Becare,
according to Müller now represented by <em class="gesperrt">Markari</em>
(lat. 12° N.) Yule conjectures that it must have
been between Kanetti and Kolum in Travancore.
Regarding the trade of this place we may quote a
remark from Vincent. “We find,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> “that
throughout the whole which the <i>Periplûs</i> mentions
of India we have a catalogue of the exports and
imports only at the two ports of Barugaza and
Nelcynda, and there seems to be a distinction fixed
between the articles appropriate to each. Fine
muslins and ordinary cottons are the principal
commodities of the first; tortoise shell, precious
stones, silk, and above all pepper, seem to have been
procurable only at the latter. This pepper is said
to be brought to this port from Cottonara, famous
to this hour for producing the best pepper in the
world except that of Sumatra. The pre-eminence
of these two ports will account for the little that
is said of the others by the author, and why he has
left us so few characters by which we may distinguish
one from another.”</p>

<p>Our author on concluding his account of Nelkunda
interrupts his narrative to relate the incidents
of the important discovery of the monsoon
made by that Columbus of antiquity Hippalus.
This account, Vincent remarks, naturally excites a
curiosity in the mind to enquire how it should
happen that the monsoon should have been noticed
by Nearkhos, and that from the time of his voyage
for 300 years no one should have attempted a
direct course till Hippalus ventured to commit
himself to the ocean. He is of opinion that there
was a direct passage by the monsoons both in
going to and coming from India in use among
the Arabians before the Greeks adopted it, and
that Hippalus frequenting these seas as a pilot or
merchant, had met with Indian or Arabian traders
who made their voyages in a more compendious
manner than the Greeks, and that he collected
information from them which he had both the prudence
and courage to adopt, just as Columbus, while
owing much to his own nautical experience and
fortitude was still under obligations to the Portuguese,
who had been resolving the great problems
in the art of navigation for almost a century previous
to his expedition.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_55"></a>55. At the very mouth of this river lies
another village, <em class="gesperrt">Bakare</em>, to which the ships
despatched from Nelkunda come down <i>empty</i>
and ride at anchor off shore while taking in
cargo: for the river, it may be noted, has sunken
reefs and shallows which make its navigation
difficult. The sign by which those who come
hither by sea know they are nearing land is
their meeting with snakes, which are here of a
black colour, not so long as those already mentioned,
like serpents about the head, and with
eyes the colour of blood.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(55) <em class="gesperrt">Nelkunda</em> appears to have been the
limit of our author’s voyage along the coast of
India, for in the sequel of his narrative he defines
but vaguely the situation of the places which he
notices, while his details are scanty, and sometimes
grossly inaccurate. Thus he makes the Malabar
Coast extend southwards beyond Cape Comorin
as far at least as Kolkhoi (near Tutikorin) on the
Coromandel coast, and like many ancient writers,
represents Ceylon as stretching westward almost
as far as Africa.</p>

<p><a id="para_56"></a>56. The ships which frequent these ports
are of a large size, on account of the great
amount and bulkiness of the pepper and betel
of which their lading consists. The imports
here are principally—</p>

<p>The proper season to set sail from Egypt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
this part of India is about the month of July—that
is, Epiphi.</p>

<p>57. The whole round of the voyage from
<em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Eudaimôn Arabia</em>, which we
have just described, used to be performed in
small vessels which kept close to shore and
followed its windings, but <em class="gesperrt">Hippalos</em> was the
pilot who first, by observing the bearings of the
ports and the configuration of the sea, discovered
the direct course across the ocean; whence as,
at the season when our own Etesians are
blowing, a periodical wind from the ocean likewise
blows in the Indian Sea, this wind, which
is the south-west, is, it seems, called in these
seas Hippalos [after the name of the pilot who
first discovered the <i>passage by means of it</i>].
From the time of this discovery to the present
day, merchants who sail for India either from
<em class="gesperrt">Kanê</em>, or, as others do, from <em class="gesperrt">Arômata</em>, if
Limurikê be their destination, must often change
their tack, but if they are bound for <em class="gesperrt">Barugaza</em>
and <em class="gesperrt">Skythia</em>, they are not retarded for
more than three days, after which, committing
themselves to the monsoon which blows right
in the direction of their course, they stand far
out to sea, leaving all the gulfs we have mentioned
in the distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="para_58"></a>58. After <em class="gesperrt">Bakare</em> occurs the mountain
called Pyrrhos (or the Red) towards the south,
near another district of the country called
<em class="gesperrt">Paralia</em> (where the pearl-fisheries are which
belong to king Pandiôn), and a city of the name
of <em class="gesperrt">Kolkhoi</em>. In this tract the first place
met with is called <em class="gesperrt">Balita</em>, which has a good
harbour and a village on its shore. Next to
this is another place called <em class="gesperrt">Komar</em>, where is
the cape of the same name and a haven. Those
who wish to consecrate the closing part of their
lives to religion come hither and bathe and
engage themselves to celibacy. This is also
done by women; since it is related that the
goddess (<i>Kumârî</i>) once on a time resided at the
place and bathed. From <em class="gesperrt">Komarei</em> (towards the
south) the country extends as far as <em class="gesperrt">Kolkhoi</em>,
where the fishing for pearls is carried on.
Condemned criminals are employed in this service.
King Pandiôn is the owner of the fishery.
To <em class="gesperrt">Kolkhoi</em> succeeds another coast lying
along a gulf having a district in the interior
bearing the name of <em class="gesperrt">Argalou</em>. In this single
place are obtained the pearls collected near the
island of <em class="gesperrt">Epiodôros</em>. From it are exported
the muslins called <i>ebargareitides</i>.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(58) The first place mentioned after <em class="gesperrt">Bakare</em>
is <em class="gesperrt">Pyrrhos</em>, or the Red Mountain, which extends
along a district called <em class="gesperrt">Paralia</em>. “There are,”
says Dr. Caldwell (Introd. p. 99), “three Paralias
mentioned by the Greeks, two by Ptolemy ...
one by the author of the <i>Periplûs</i>. The Paralia
mentioned by the latter corresponded to Ptolemy’s
country of the Ἄïοι, and that of the Καρεοι,
that is, to South Travancore and South Tinnevelly.
It commenced at the Red Cliffs south of
Quilon, and included not only Cape Comorin
but also Κόλχοι, where the pearl fishing was carried
on, which belonged to King Pandiôn. Dr.
Burnell identifies Paralia with Parali, which
he states is an old name for Travancore, but I am
not quite able to adopt this view.” “Paralia,” he
adds afterwards, “may possibly have corresponded
in meaning, if not in sound, to some native word
meaning coast,—viz., Karei.” On this coast is a
place called <em class="gesperrt">Balita</em>, which is perhaps the <em class="gesperrt">Bammala</em>
of Ptolemy (VII. i. 9), which Mannert identifies
with Manpalli, a little north of Anjenga.</p>

<p>60. Among the marts and anchorages along
this shore to which merchants from Limurikê
and the north resort, the most conspicuous are
<em class="gesperrt">Kamara</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Podoukê</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Sôpatma</em>,
which occur in the order in which we have
named them. In these marts are found those
native vessels for coasting voyages which trade
as far as Limurikê, and another kind called
<i>sangara</i>, mode by fastening together large
vessels formed each of a single timber, and also
others called <i>kolandiophônta</i>, which are of great
bulk and employed for voyages to <em class="gesperrt">Khrusê</em>
and the <em class="gesperrt">Ganges</em>. These marts import all the
commodities which reach Limurikê for
commercial purposes, absorbing likewise nearly
every species of goods brought from Egypt,
and most descriptions of all the goods exported
from Limurikê and disposed of on this
coast <i>of India</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(60) We now reach the great promontory called
in the <i>Periplûs</i> <em class="gesperrt">Komar</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Komarei</em>, Cape
Kumârî. “It has derived its name,” says Caldwell,
“from the Sans. <i>Kumârî</i>, a virgin, one of the
names of the goddess Durgâ, the presiding divinity
of the place, but the shape which this
word has taken is, especially in <i>komar</i>, distinctively
Tamilian.” In ordinary Tamil <i>Kumârî</i>
becomes <i>Kumări</i>; and in the vulgar dialect
of the people residing in the neighbourhood of
the Cape a virgin is neither Kumârî nor Kumări
but Kŭmăr pronounced Kŏmar. It is remarkable
that this vulgar corruption of the Sanskrit is
identical with the name given to the place by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
author of the <i>Periplûs</i>.... The monthly bathing in
honor of the goddess Durgâ is still continued at
Cape Comorin, but is not practised to the same
extent as in ancient times.... Through the continued
encroachments of the sea, the harbour the
Greek mariners found at Cape Comorin and the
fort (if φρουριον is the correct reading for βριάριον
of the MS.) have completely disappeared; but a
fresh water well remains in the centre of a rock, a
little way out at sea. Regarding <em class="gesperrt">Kolkhoi</em>, the
next place mentioned after Komari, the same
authority as we have seen places it (<i>Ind. Ant.</i> vol.
VI. p. 80) near Tuticorin. It is mentioned by
Ptolemy and in the <i>Peutinger Tables</i>, where it is
called ‘Colcis Indorum’. The Gulf of Manaar was
called by the Greeks the Colchic Gulf. The Tami[l:]
name of the place Kolkei is almost identical with
the Greek. “The place,” according to Caldwell, “is
now about three miles inland, but there are abundant
traces of its having once stood on the coast, and
I have found the tradition that it was once the seat
of the pearl fishery, still surviving amongst its inhabitants.”
After the sea had retired from Κόλχοι ... a
new emporium arose on the coast. This was
<em class="gesperrt">Kâyal</em>, the Cael of Marco Polo. Kâyal in turn
became in time too far from the sea ... and Tuticorin
(<em class="gesperrt">Tûttrukuḍi</em>) was raised instead by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Portuguese from the position of a fishing village
to that of the most important port on the southern
Coromandel coast. The identification of Kolkoi
with Kolkei is one of much importance. Being
perfectly certain it helps forward other identifications.
<i>Kol.</i> in Tami[l:] means ‘to slay.’ <i>Kei</i> is
‘hand.’ It was the first capital of Pandiôn.</p>

<p>The coast beyond <em class="gesperrt">Kolkhoi</em>, which has an inland
district belonging to it called <em class="gesperrt">Argalou</em>, is
indented by a gulf called by Ptolemy the Argarik—now
Palk Bay. Ptolemy mentions also a promontory
called <em class="gesperrt">Kôru</em> and beyond it a city called <em class="gesperrt">Argeirou</em>
and an emporium called <em class="gesperrt">Salour</em>. This Kôru
of Ptolemy, Caldwell thinks, represents the
<em class="gesperrt">Kôlis</em> of the geographers who preceded him,
and the <em class="gesperrt">Koṭi</em> of Tami[l:], and identifies it with
“the island promontory of <em class="gesperrt">Râmeśvaram</em>, the
point of land from which there was always the
nearest access from Southern India to Ceylon.”
An island occurs in these parts, called that of
<em class="gesperrt">Epiodôros</em>, noted for its pearl fishery, on
which account Ritter would identify it with
the island of Manaar, which Ptolemy, as Mannert
thinks, speaks of as Νάνιγηρίς (VII. i. 95). Müller
thinks, however, it may be compared with Ptolemy’s
<em class="gesperrt">Kôru</em>, and so be Râmeśvaram.</p>

<p>This coast has commercial intercourse not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
with the Malabar ports, but also with the Ganges
and the Golden Khersonese. For the trade with
the former a species of canoes was used called
<i>Sangara</i>. The Maļayâlam name of these, Caldwell
says, is <i>Changâdam</i>, in Tuļa <i>Jangâla</i>, compare
Sanskrit <i>Samghâdam</i> a raft (<i>Ind. Ant.</i> vol. I.
p. 309). The large vessels employed for the
Eastern trade were called <i>Kolandiophonta</i>, a name
which Caldwell confesses his inability to explain.</p>

<p>Three cities and ports are named in the order of
their occurrence which were of great commercial
importance, <em class="gesperrt">Kamara</em>, <em class="gesperrt">Podoukê</em>, and <em class="gesperrt">Sôpatma</em>.
<em class="gesperrt">Kamara</em> may perhaps be, as Müller thinks,
the emporium which Ptolemy calls <em class="gesperrt">Khabêris</em>,
situated at the mouth of the River <em class="gesperrt">Khabêros</em>
(now, the Kavery), perhaps, as Dr. Burnell suggests,
the modern Kaveripattam. (<i>Ind. Ant.</i> vol.
VII. p. 40). <em class="gesperrt">Podoukê</em> appears in Ptolemy as
Podoukê. It is <em class="gesperrt">Puduchchêri</em>, <i>i. e.</i> ‘new
town,’ now well known as Pondicherry; so Bohlen,
Ritter, and Benfey. [Yule and Lassen place it at
Pulikât]. <em class="gesperrt">Sôpatma</em> is not mentioned in
Ptolemy, nor can it now be traced. In Sanskrit
it transliterates into <i>Su-patna</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, fair town.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_61"></a>61. Near the region which succeeds, where
the course of the voyage now bends to the east,
there lies out in the open sea stretching towards
the west the island now called <em class="gesperrt">Palaisimoundou</em>,
but by the ancients <em class="gesperrt">Taprobanê</em>.
To cross over to the northern side
of it takes a day. In the south part it gradually
stretches towards the west till it nearly
reaches the opposite coast of <em class="gesperrt">Azania</em>. It produces
pearl, precious (<i>transparent</i>) stones,
muslins, and tortoise-shell.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(61) The next place noticed is the Island of
Ceylon, which is designated <em class="gesperrt">Palaisimoundou</em>,
with the remark that its former name was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
<em class="gesperrt">Taprobanê</em>. This is the Greek transliteration of
Tâmraparnî, the name given by a band of colonists
from Magadha to the place where they first
landed in Ceylon, and which was afterwards extended
to the whole island. It is singular, Dr.
Caldwell remarks, that this is also the name of
the principal river in Tinnevelly on the opposite
coast of India, and he infers that the colony
referred to might previously have formed a settlement
in Tinnevelly at the mouth of the Tâmraparṇi
river—perhaps at Kolkei, the earliest residence
of the Pâṇḍya kings. The passage in the
<i>Periplûs</i> which refers to the island is very corrupt.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_62"></a>62.(<i>Returning to the coast</i>,) not far from the
three marts we have mentioned lies <em class="gesperrt">Masalia</em>,
the seaboard of a country extending far inland.
Here immense quantities of fine muslins are
manufactured. From <em class="gesperrt">Masalia</em> the course of
the voyage lies eastward across a neighbouring
bay to <em class="gesperrt">Dêsarênê</em>, which has the breed of
elephants called Bôsarê. Leaving <em class="gesperrt">Dêsarênê</em>
the course is northerly, passing a variety of
barbarous tribes, among which are the <em class="gesperrt">Kirrhadai</em>,
savages whose noses are flattened to the
face, and another tribe, that of the <em class="gesperrt">Bargusoi</em>,
as well as the <em class="gesperrt">Hîppioprosôpoi</em> <i>or</i> <em class="gesperrt">Makroprosôpoi</em>
(the horse faced or long faced
men), who are reported to be cannibals.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(62) Recurring to the mainland, the narrative
notices a district called <em class="gesperrt">Masalia</em>, where
great quantities of cotton were manufactured.
This is the <em class="gesperrt">Maïsôlia</em> of Ptolemy, the region in
which he places the mouths of a river the <em class="gesperrt">Maisôlos</em>,
which Benfey identifies with the Godâvarî,
in opposition to others who would make it the
Krishnâ, which is perhaps Ptolemy’s <em class="gesperrt">Tuna</em>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
name Maisôlia is taken from the Sanskrit Mausala,
preserved in Machhlipatana, now Masulipatam.
Beyond this, after an intervening gulf running
eastward is crossed, another district occurs, <em class="gesperrt">Desarênê</em>,
noted for its elephants. This is not mentioned
by Ptolemy, but a river with a similar name,
the <em class="gesperrt">Dôsarôn</em>, is found in his enumeration of
the rivers which occur between the Maisôlos and
the Ganges. As it is the last in the list it may
probably be, as Lassen supposes, the Brâhmini.
Our author however places Desarênê at a much
greater distance from the Ganges, for he peoples
the intermediate space with a variety of tribes
which Ptolemy relegates to the East of the river.
The first of these tribes is that of the <em class="gesperrt">Kirrâdai</em>
(Sanskrit, Kirâtas), whose features are of the
Mongolian type. Next are the <em class="gesperrt">Bargusoi</em>, not
mentioned by Ptolemy, but perhaps to be identified
with the cannibal race he speaks of, the
<em class="gesperrt">Barousai</em> thought by Yule to be possibly the
inhabitants of the Nikobar islands, and lastly the
tribe of the long or horse-faced men who were also
cannibals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_63"></a>63. After passing these the course turns
again to the east, and if you sail with the ocean
to your right and the coast far to your left, you
reach the Ganges and the extremity of the continent
towards the east <i>called</i> <em class="gesperrt">Khrusê</em> (the
Golden Khersonese). The river of this region
called the <em class="gesperrt">Ganges</em> is the largest in India;
it has an <i>annual</i> increase and decrease like the
Nile, and there is on it a mart called after it,
Gangê, through which passes <i>a considerable
traffic</i> consisting of betel, the Gangetic spikenard,
pearl, and the finest of all muslins—those
called the Gangetic. In this locality also there
is said to be a gold mine and a gold coin called
<i>Kaltis</i>. Near this river there is an island of
the ocean called <em class="gesperrt">Khrusê</em> (or the Golden),
which lies directly under the rising sun and at
the extremity of the world towards the east.
It produces the finest tortoise-shell that is found
throughout the whole of the Erythræan Sea.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(63) When this coast of savages and monsters
is left behind, the course lies eastward, and leads
to the Ganges, which is the greatest river of
India, and adjoins the extremity of the Eastern
continent called <em class="gesperrt">Khrusê</em>, or the Golden. Near
the river, or, according to Ptolemy, on the third of
its mouths stands a great emporium of trade
called <em class="gesperrt">Gangê</em>, exporting <i>Malabathrum</i> and cottons
and other commodities. Its exact position
there are not sufficient data to determine. Khrusê
is not only the name of the last part of the continent,
but also of an island lying out in the ocean
to eastward, not far from the Ganges. It is the
last part of the world which is said to be inhabited.
The situation of Khrusê is differently defined by
different ancient authors. It was not known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the Alexandrine geographers. Pliny seems to
have preserved the most ancient report circulated
regarding it. He says (VI. xxiii. 80): “Beyond the
mouth of the Indus are <em class="gesperrt">Chryse</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Argyre</em>
abounding in metals as I believe, for I can hardly
credit what some have related that the soil consists
of gold and silver.” Mela (III. 7) assigns to it a very
different position, asserting it to be near <em class="gesperrt">Tabis</em>,
the last spur of the range of Taurus. He therefore
places it where Eratosthenês places <em class="gesperrt">Thînai</em>, to the
north of the Ganges on the confines of the Indian
and Skythian oceans. Ptolemy, in whose time the
Transgangetic world was better known, refers it
to the peninsula of Malacca, the Golden Khersonese.</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_64"></a>64. Beyond this region, immediately under
the north, where the sea terminates outwards,
there lies somewhere in <em class="gesperrt">Thîna</em> a very great
city,—not on the coast, but in the interior of
the country, called <em class="gesperrt">Thîna</em>,—from which silk,
whether in the raw state or spun into thread</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>and woven into cloth, is brought by land to
Barugaza through Baktria, or by the Ganges to
Limurikê. To penetrate into <em class="gesperrt">Thîna</em> is not
an easy undertaking, and but few <i>merchants</i>
come from it, and that rarely. Its situation is
under the Lesser Bear, and it is said to be conterminous
with the remotest end of Pontos,
and that part of the Kaspian Sea which adjoins
the Maiôtic Lake, along with which it issues by
<i>one and</i> the same mouth into the ocean.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>(64) The last place which the <i>Periplûs</i> mentions
is Thînai, an inland city of the <em class="gesperrt">Thînai</em> or
<em class="gesperrt">Sinai</em>, having a large commerce in silk and
woollen stuffs. The ancient writers are not at all
agreed as to its position. Colonel Yule thinks it
was probably the city described by Marco Polo
under the name of <em class="gesperrt">Kenjan-fu</em> (that is Singan-fu
or Chauggan,) the most celebrated city
in Chinese history, and the capital of several of
the most potent dynasties. It was the metropolis
of Shi Hwengti of the T’Sin dynasty, properly
the first emperor, and whose conquests almost
intersected those of his contemporary Ptolemy
Euergetês—(vide Yule’s <i>Travels of Marco Polo</i>,
vol. II. p. 21).</p></blockquote>

<p><a id="para_65"></a>65. On the confines, however, of <em class="gesperrt">Thînai</em>
an annual fair is held, attended by a race of men
of squat figure, with their face very broad, but
mild in disposition, called the <em class="gesperrt">Sesatai</em>, who in
appearance resemble wild animals. They come
with their wives and children to this fair, bringing
heavy loads of goods wrapped up in mats
resembling in outward appearance the early
leaves of the vine. Their place of assembly is
where their own territory borders with that of
Thînai; and here, squatted on the mats on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
they exhibit their wares, they feast for several
days, after which they return to their homes in
the interior. On observing their retreat the
people of Thînai, repairing to the spot, collect the
mats on which they had been sitting, and taking
out the fibres, which are called <i>petroi</i>, from the
reeds, they put the leaves two and two together,
and roll them up into slender balls, through
which they pass the fibres extracted from the
reeds. Three kinds of Malabathrum are thus
made—that of the large ball, that of the middle,
and that of the small, according to the size of
the leaf of which the balls are formed. Hence
there are three kinds of Malabathrum, which
after being made up are forwarded to India by
the manufacturers.</p>

<p>66. All the regions beyond this are unexplored,
being difficult of access by reason of the
extreme rigour of the climate and the severe
frosts, or perhaps because such is the will of
the divine power.</p>

<p>The coasting voyage from the mouth of the
Indus to the head of the Persian Gulf, designed
by Alexander the Great, and executed by Nearkhos,
may be regarded as the most important achievement
of the ancients in navigation. It opened
up, as Vincent remarks, a communication between
Europe and the most distant countries of Asia,
and, at a later period, was the source and origin
of the Portuguese discoveries, and consequently
the primary cause, however remote, of the British
establishments in India. A Journal of this
voyage was written by Nearkhos himself, which,
though not extant in its original form, has been
preserved for us by Arrian, who embodied its
contents in his little work on India,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> which he
wrote as a sequel to his history of the expedition
of Alexander.</p>

<p>Nearkhos as a writer must be acknowledged to
be most scrupulously honest and exact,—for the
result of explorations made in modern times
along the shores which he passed in the course
of his voyage shows that his description of them
is accurate even in the most minute particulars.
His veracity was nevertheless oppugned in ancient
times by Strabo, who unjustly stigmatises the
whole class of the Greek writers upon India as
mendacious. “Generally speaking,” he says (II.
i. 9),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> “the men who have written upon Indian
affairs were a set of liars. Deimakhos holds the
first place in the list, Megasthenês comes next,
while Onêsikritos and Nearkhos, with others of
the same class, stammer out a few words of truth.”
(παραψελλίζοντες). Strabo, however, in spite of this
censure did not hesitate to use Nearkhos as one
of his chief authorities for his description of
India, and is indebted to him for many facts relating
to that country, which, however extraordinary
they might appear to his contemporaries,
have been all confirmed by subsequent observation.
It is therefore fairly open to doubt whether
Strabo was altogether sincere in his ill opinion,
seeing it had but little, if any, influence on his practice.
We know at all events that he was too much
inclined to undervalue any writer who retailed
fables, without discriminating whether the writer
set them down as facts, or merely as stories, which
he had gathered from hearsay.</p>

<p>In modern times, the charge of mendacity has
been repeated by Hardouin and Huet. There are,
however, no more than two passages of the Journal
which can be adduced to support this imputation.
The first is that in which the excessive
breadth of 200 stadia is given to the Indus, and
the second that in which it is asserted that at
Malana (situated in 25°&nbsp;17´ of N. latitude) the
shadows at noon were observed to fall southward,
and this in the month of November. With
regard to the first charge, it may be supposed that
the breadth assigned to the Indus was probably
that which it was observed to have when in a
state of inundation, and with regard to the second,
it may be met by the supposition, which is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
admissible, that Arrian may have misapprehended
in some measure the import of the statement as
made by Nearkhos. The passage will be afterwards
examined,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> but in the meantime we may say,
with Vincent, that if the difficulty it presents
admits of no satisfactory solution, the misstatement
ought not, as standing alone, to be insisted
upon to the invalidation of the whole work.</p>

<p>But another charge besides that of mendacity
has been preferred against the Journal. Dodwell
has denied its authenticity. His attack is based
on the following passage in Pliny (VI. 23):—Onesciriti
et Nearchi navigatio nec nomina habet
mansionum nec spatia. <i>The Journal of Onesicritus
and Nearchus has neither the names of the anchorages
nor the measure of the distances.</i> From this Dodwell
argues that, as the account of the voyage in
Arrian contains both the names and the distances,
it could not have been a transcript of the Journal
of Nearkhos, which according to Pliny gave neither
names nor distances. Now, in the first place, it
may well be asked, why the authority of Pliny,
who is by no means always a careful writer,
should be set so high as to override all other
testimony, for instance, that of Arrian himself, who
expressly states in the outset of his narrative that
he intended to give the account of the voyage which
had been written by Nearkhos. In the second
place, the passage in question is probably corrupt,
or if not, it is in direct conflict with the passage
which immediately follows it, and contains Pliny’s
own summary of the voyage in which little else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
is given than the names of the anchorages and
the distances. Dodwell was aware of the inconsistency
of the two passages, and endeavoured to
explain it away. In this he entirely fails, and
there can therefore be no reasonable doubt, that
in Arrian’s work we have a record of the voyage
as authentic as it is veracious.</p>

<p>Of that record we proceed to give a brief abstract,
adding a few particulars gathered from other
sources.</p>

<p>The fleet with which Nearkhos accomplished
the voyage consisted of war-galleys and transports
which had been partly built and partly collected
on the banks of the river Hydaspes (now the
Jhelam), where Alexander had supplied them with
crews by selecting from his troops such men as
had a knowledge of seamanship. The fleet thus
manned sailed slowly down the Hydaspes, the
Akesinês, and the Indus, its movements being
regulated by those of the army, which, in marching
down towards the sea, was engaged in reducing the
warlike tribes settled along the banks of these
rivers. This downward voyage occupied, according
to Strabo, ten months, but it probably did not occupy
more than nine. The fleet having at length
reached the apex of the Delta formed by the Indus
remained in that neighbourhood for some time at
a place called Pattala, which has generally been
identified with Ṭhaṭha—a town near to where the
western arm of the Indus bifurcates,—but which
Cunningham and others would prefer to identify
with Nirankol or Haidarâbâd.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> From Pattala<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Alexander sailed down the western stream of the
river, where some of his ships were damaged and
others destroyed by encountering the Bore, a
phenomenon as alarming as it was new to the
Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> He returned to Pattala, and thence made
an excursion down the Eastern stream, which he
found less difficult to navigate. On again returning
to Pattala he removed his fleet down to a station
on the Western branch of the river (at an island
called Killouta),<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> which was at no great distance
from the sea. He then set out on his return to
Persia, leaving instructions with Nearkhos to start
on the voyage as soon as the calming of the
monsoon should render navigation safe. It was
the king’s intention to march near to the coast,
and to collect at convenient stations supplies for
the victualling of the fleet, but he found that such
a route was impracticable, and he was obliged to
lead his army through the inland provinces which
lay between India and his destination, Sûsa.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> He
left Leonnatos, however, behind him in the country
of the Oreitai, with instructions to render every
assistance in his power to the expedition under
Nearkhos when it should reach that part of the
coast.</p>

<p>Nearkhos remained in the harbour at Killouta
for about a month after Alexander had departed,
and then sailed during a temporary lull in the
monsoon, as he was apprehensive of being at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>tacked
by the natives who had been but imperfectly
subjugated, and whose spirit was hostile.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The
date on which he set sail is fixed by Vincent as
the 1st of October in the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 326. He proceeded
slowly down the river, and anchored first
at a place called Stoura, which was only 100 stadia
distant from the station they had quitted. Here
the fleet remained for two days, when it proceeded
to an anchorage only 30 stadia farther down the
stream at a place called Kaumana.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Thence
it proceeded to Koreatis (v. 1. Koreëstis)—where it
again anchored. When once more under weigh its
progress was soon arrested by a dangerous rock
or bar which obstructed the mouth of the river.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
After some delay this difficulty was overcome, and
the fleet was conducted in safety into the open
main, and onward to an island called Krôkala
(150 stadia distant from the bar), where it remained
at anchor throughout the day following
its arrival. On leaving this island Nearkhos
had Mount Eiros (now Manora) on his right hand,
and a low flat island on his left; and this, as
Cunningham remarks, is a very accurate description
of the entrance to Karâchi harbour.
The fleet was conducted into this harbour, now
so well known as the great emporium of the trade
of the Indus, and here, as the monsoon was still
blowing with great violence, it remained for four
and twenty days. The harbour was so commodious
and secure that Nearkhos designated it the Port<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
of Alexander. It was well sheltered by an island
lying close to its mouth, called by Arrian, Bibakta,
but by Pliny, Bibaga, and by Philostratos, Biblos.</p>

<p>The expedition took its departure from this
station on the 3rd of November. It suffered both
from stress of weather and from shortness of provisions
until it reached Kôkala on the coast of
the Oreitai, where it took on board the supplies
which had been collected for its use by the exertions
of Leonnatos. Here it remained for about
10 days, and by the time of its departure the
monsoon had settled in its favour, so that the
courses daily accomplished were now of much
greater length than formerly. The shores, however,
of the Ikhthyophagoi, which succeeded to
those of the Oreitai, were so miserably barren
and inhospitable that provisions were scarcely procurable,
and Nearkhos was apprehensive lest the
men, famished and despairing, should desert the
ships. Their sufferings were not relieved till they
approached the straits, which open into the Persian
Gulf. When within the straits, they entered the
mouth of the river Anamis (now the Minâb or Ibrahim
river), and having landed, formed a dockyard
and a camp upon its banks. This place lay in Harmozeia,
a most fertile and beautiful district belonging
to Karmania. Nearkhos, having here learned
that Alexander was not more than a 5 days’
journey from the sea, proceeded into the interior
to meet him, and report the safety of the expedition.
During his absence the ships were repaired
and provisioned, and therefore soon after his
return to the camp he gave orders for the resumption
of the voyage. The time spent at Har<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>mozeia
was one and twenty days. The fleet
again under weigh coasted the islands lying at
the mouth of the gulf, and then having shaped
its course towards the mainland, passed the
western shores of Karmania and those of Persis,
till it arrived at the mouth of the Sitakos (now the
Kara-Agach), where it was again repaired and
supplied with provisions, remaining for the same
number of days as at the Anamis. One of the
next stations at which it touched was Mesembria,
which appears to have been situated in the neighbourhood
of the modern Bushire. The coast of
Persis was difficult to navigate on account of
intricate and oozy channels, and of shoals and
breakers which frequently extended far out to
sea. The coast which succeeded, that of Sousis
(from which Persis is separated by the river
Arosis or Oroatis, now the Tâb) was equally
difficult and dangerous to navigate, and therefore
the fleet no longer crept along the shore,
but stood out more into the open sea. At the
head of the gulf Sousis bends to westward,
and here are the mouths of the Tigris and
Euphrates, which appear in those days to have
entered the sea by separate channels. It was
the intention of Nearkhos to have sailed up the
former river, but he passed its mouth unawares,
and continued sailing westward till he reached
Diridôtis (or Terêdon), an emporium in Babylonia,
situated on the Pallacopas branch of the
Euphrates. From Diridôtis he retraced his course,
and entering the mouth of the Tigris sailed up its
stream till he reached the lower end of a great
lake (not now existing), through which its current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
flowed. At the upper end of this lake was a
village called Aginis, said to have been 500 stadia
distant from Sousa. Nearkhos did not, as has
been erroneously supposed by some, sail up the
lake to Aginis, but entered the mouth of a river
which flows into its south-eastern extremity,
called the Pasitigris or Eulæus, the Ulai of the
Prophet Daniel, now the Karûn. The fleet proceeded
up this river, and came to a final anchor
in its stream immediately below a bridge, which
continued the highway from Persia to Sousa.
This bridge, according to Ritter and Rawlinson,
crossed the Pasitigris at a point near the
modern village of Ahwaz. Here the fleet and the
army were happily reunited. Alexander on his
arrival embraced Nearkhos with cordial warmth,
and rewarded appropriately the splendid services
which he had rendered by bringing the expedition
safely through so many hardships and perils to its
destination. The date on which the fleet anchored
at the bridge is fixed by Vincent for the 24th of
February <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 325, so that the whole voyage was
performed in 146 days, or somewhat less than 5
months.</p>

<p>XVIII. When the fleet formed for Alexander
upon the banks of the Hydaspes was now ready,
he provided crews for the vessels by collecting
all the Phœnikians and all the Kyprians and
Egyptians who had followed him in his Eastern
campaigns, and from these he selected such as
were skilled in seamanship to manage the vessels
and work the oars. He had besides in his army
not a few islanders familiar with that kind of
work, and also natives both of Ionia and of the
Hellespont. The following officers he appointed as
Commanders of the different galleys<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>:—</p>

<p>The Pilot and Master of Alexander’s own ship
was Onêsikritos of Astypalaia, and the Secretary-General
of the fleet Euagoras, the son of Eukleôn,
a Corinthian. Nearkhos, the son of Androtîmos,
a Kretan by birth, but a citizen of Amphipolis on
the Strymôn was appointed as Admiral of the
expedition.</p>

<p>When these dispositions had been all completed,
Alexander sacrificed to his ancestral gods, and to
such as had been indicated by the oracle; also to
Poseidôn and Amphitritê and the Nêreids, and to
Okeanos himself, and to the River Hydaspês, from
which he was setting forth on his enterprise; and
to the Akesinês into which the Hydaspês pours its
stream, and to the Indus which receives both
these rivers. He further celebrated the occasion
by holding contests in music and gymnastics,
and by distributing to the whole army, rank by
rank, the sacrificial victims.</p>

<p>XIX. When all the preparations for the voyage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
had been made, Alexander ordered Krateros, with
a force of horse and foot, to go to one side of the
Hydaspês; while Hephaistiôn commanding a still
larger force, which included 200 elephants, should
march in a parallel line on the other side. Alexander
himself had under his immediate command
the body of foot guards called the Hypaspists, and
all the archers, and what was called the companion-cavalry,—a
force consisting in all of 8,000 men.
The troops under Krateros and Hephaistiôn marching
in advance of the fleet had received instructions
where they were to wait its arrival. Philip, whom
he had appointed satrap of this region, was despatched
to the banks of the Akesinês with another
large division, for by this time he had a following
of 120,000 soldiers,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> including those whom he had
himself led up from the sea-coast, as well as the
recruits enlisted by the agents whom he had
deputed to collect an army, when he admitted to
his ranks barbarous tribes of all countries in
whatever way they might be armed. Then weighing
anchor, he sailed down the Hydaspês to its
point of junction with the Akesinês. The ships
numbered altogether 1800, including the long
narrow war galleys, the round-shaped roomy merchantmen,
and the transports for carrying horses
and provisions to feed the army. But how the
fleet sailed down the rivers, and what tribes
Alexander conquered in the course of the voyage,
and how he was in danger among the Malli,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
how he was wounded in their country, and how
Peukestas and Leonnatos covered him with their
shields when he fell,—all these incidents have
been already related in my other work, that which
is written in the Attic dialect.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> My present object
is to give an account of the coasting voyage which
Nearkhos accomplished with the fleet when starting
from the mouths of the Indus he sailed through
the great ocean as far as the Persian Gulf, called
by some the Red Sea.</p>

<p>XX. Nearkhos himself has supplied a narrative
of this voyage, which runs to this effect. Alexander,
he informs us, had set his heart on navigating
the whole circuit of the sea which extends from
India to Persia, but the length of the voyage made
him hesitate, and the possibility of the destruction
of his fleet, should it be cast on some desert
coast either quite harbourless or too barren to
furnish adequate supplies; in which case a great
stain tarnishing the splendour of his former actions
would obliterate all his good fortune. His
ambition, however, to be always doing something
new and astonishing prevailed over all his
scruples. Then arose a difficulty as to what commander
he should choose, having genius sufficient
for working out his plans, and a difficulty also
with regard to the men on ship-board how he
could overcome their fear, that in being despatched
on such a service they were recklessly sent
into open peril. Nearkhos here tells us that
Alexander consulted him on the choice of a commander,
and that when the king had mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
one man after another, rejecting all, some because
they were not inclined to expose themselves for
his sake to danger, others because they were of a
timid temper, others because their only thought
was how to get home, making this and that
objection to each in turn, Nearkhos then proffered
his own services in these terms: “I, then,
O king, engage to command the expedition, and,
under the divine protection, will conduct the fleet
and the people on board safe into Persia, if the sea
be that way navigable, and the undertaking within
the power of man to perform.” Alexander
made a pretence of refusing the offer, saying that he
could not think of exposing any friend of his to the
distresses and hazard of such a voyage, but Nearkhos,
so far from withdrawing his proposal, only
persisted the more in pressing its acceptance upon
him. Alexander, it need not be said, warmly
appreciated the promptitude to serve him shown
by Nearkhos, and appointed him to be commander-in-chief
of the expedition. When this
became known, it had a great effect in calming
the minds of the troops ordered on this service
and on the minds of the sailors, since they felt
assured that Alexander would never have sent
forth Nearkhos into palpable danger unless their
lives were to be preserved. At the same time the
splendour with which the ships were equipped,
and the enthusiasm of the officers vying with
each other who should collect the best men, and
have his complement most effective, inspired even
those who had long hung back with nerve for
the work, and a good hope that success would
crown the undertaking. It added to the cheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>fulness
pervading the army that Alexander himself
sailed out from both the mouths of the Indus
into the open main when he sacrificed victims to
Poseidôn and all the other sea-deities, and presented
gifts of great magnificence to the sea; and
so the men trusting to the immeasurable good
fortune which had hitherto attended all the projects
of Alexander, believed there was nothing he might
not dare—nothing but would to him be feasible.</p>

<p>XXI. When the Etesian winds,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> which continue
all the hot season blowing landward from
the sea, making navigation on that coast impracticable,
had subsided, then the expedition
started on the voyage in the year when Kephisidôros
was Archon at Athens, on the 20th
day of the month Boëdromion according to the
Athenian Kalendar, but as the Makedonians and
Asiatics reckon * * in the 11th year of the
reign of Alexander.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Nearkhos, before putting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
sea sacrifices to Zeus the Preserver, and celebrates,
as Alexander had done, gymnastic games. Then
clearing out of harbour they end the first day’s
voyage by anchoring in the Indus at a creek called
Stoura, where they remain for two days. The
distance of this place from the station they had
just left was 100 stadia. On the third day they
resumed the voyage, but proceeded no further
than 30 stadia, coming to an anchor at another
creek, where the water was now salt, for the sea
when filled with the tide ran up the creek, and
its waters even when the tide receded commingled
with the river. The name of this place was Kaumana.
The next day’s course, which was of 20
stadia only, brought them to Koreatis, where they
once more anchored in the river. When again
under weigh their progress was soon interrupted,
for a bar was visible which there obstructed the
mouth of the Indus; and the waves were heard
breaking with furious roar upon its strand which
was wild and rugged. Observing, however, that
the bar at a particular part was soft, they made a
cutting through this, 5 stadia long, <i>at low water</i>,
and on the return of the flood-tide carried the
ships through by the passage thus formed into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
open sea.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Then following the winding of the coast
they ran a course of 120 stadia, and reach Krôkala,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
a sandy island where they anchored and remained
all next day. The country adjoining was
inhabited by an Indian race called the Arabies,
whom I have mentioned in my longer work, where
it is stated that they derive their name from the
River Arabis, which flows through their country
to the sea, and parts them from the Oreitai.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Weighing from Krôkala they had on their right
hand a mountain which the natives called Eiros,
and on their left a flat island almost level with
the sea, and so near the mainland to which it
runs parallel that the intervening channel is
extremely narrow. Having quite cleared this passage
they come to anchor in a well-sheltered harbour,
which Nearkhos, finding large and commodious,
designated Alexander’s Haven. This
harbour is protected by an island lying about 2
stadia off from its entrance. It is called Bibakta,
and all the country round about Sangada.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The
existence of the harbour is due altogether to the
island which opposes a barrier to the violence of
the sea. Here heavy gales blew from seaward for
many days without intermission, and Nearkhos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
fearing lest the barbarians might, some of them,
combine to attack and plunder the camp, fortified
his position with an enclosure of stones. Here
they were obliged to remain for 24 days. The
soldiers, we learn from Nearkhos, caught mussels
and oysters, and what is called the razor-fish,
these being all of an extraordinary size as compared
with the sorts found in our own sea.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> He adds
that they had no water to drink but what was
brackish.</p>

<p>XXII. As soon as the monsoon ceased they
put again to sea, and having run fully 60 stadia
came to anchor at a sandy beach under shelter of
a desert island that lay near, called Domai.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> On
the shore itself there was no water, but 20 stadia
inland it was procured of good quality. The following
day they proceeded 300 stadia to Saranga,
where they did not arrive till night. They
anchored close to the shore, and found water at a
distance of about 8 stadia from it. Weighing from
Saranga they reach Sakala, a desert place, and
anchored. On leaving it they passed two rocks so
close to each other that the oar-blades of the
galleys grazed both, and after a course of 300
stadia they came to anchor at Morontobara.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
The harbour here was deep and capacious, and
well sheltered all round, and its waters quite
tranquil, but the entrance into it was narrow. In
the native language it was called Women’s Haven,
because a woman had been the first sovereign of
the place. They thought it a great achievement
to have passed those two rocks in safety, for when
they were passing them the sea was boisterous
and running high. They did not remain in
Morontobara, but sailed the day after their arrival,
when they had on their left hand an island which
sheltered them from the sea, and which lay so
near to the mainland that the intervening channel
looked as if it had been artificially formed. Its
length from one end to the other was 70 stadia.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
The shore was woody and the island throughout
over-grown with trees of every description. They
were not able to get fairly through this passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
till towards daybreak, for the sea was not only
rough, but also shoal, the tide being at ebb. They
sailed on continuously, and after a course of 120
stadia anchored at the mouth of the river Arabis,
where there was a spacious and very fine haven.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
The water here was not fit for drinking, for the sea
ran up the mouths of the Arabis. Having gone,
however, about 40 stadia up the river, they found
a pool from which, having drawn water, they returned
to the fleet. Near the harbour is an island
high and bare, but the sea around it supplied
oysters and fish of various kinds.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> As far as
this, the country was possessed by the Arabies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the last Indian people living in this direction;
and the parts beyond were occupied by the
Oreitai.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>XXIII. On weighing from the mouths of the
Arabia, they coasted the shores of the Oreitai, and
after running 200 stadia reached Pagala,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> where
there was a surf but nevertheless good anchorage.
The crew were obliged to remain on board, a
party, however, being sent on shore to procure
water. They sailed next morning at sunrise, and
after a course of about 430 stadia, reached
Kabana<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> in the evening, where they anchored at
some distance from the shore, which was a desert;
the violence of the surf by which the vessels were
much tossed preventing them from landing.
While running the last course the fleet had been
caught in a heavy gale blowing from seaward,
when two galleys and a transport foundered.
All the men, however, saved themselves by swimming,
as the vessels at the time of the disaster
were sailing close to the shore. They weighed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
from Kabana about midnight, and having proceeded
200 stadia arrived at Kôkala, where the
vessels <i>could not be drawn on shore</i>, but rode at
anchor out at sea. As the men, however, had
suffered severely by confinement on board,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and
were very much in want of rest, Nearkhos allowed
them to go on shore, where he formed a camp, fortifying
it in the usual manner for protection against
the barbarians. In this part of the country Leonnatos,
who had been commissioned by Alexander to
reduce the Oreitai and settle their affairs, defeated
that people and their allies in a great battle,
wherein all the leaders and 6,000 men were slain,
the loss of Leonnatos, being only 15 of his horse,
besides a few foot-soldiers, and <i>one man of note</i>
Apollophanês, the satrap of the Gedrosians.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> A
full account, however, of those transactions is
given in my other work, where it is stated that for
this service Leonnatos had a golden crown placed
upon his head by Alexander in presence of the
Makedonian army. Agreeably to orders given
by Alexander, corn had been here collected for
the victualling of the vessels, and stores sufficient
to last for 10 days were put on board. Here
also such ships as had been damaged during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
voyage were repaired, while all the mariners that
Nearkhos considered deficient in fortitude for
the enterprise, he consigned to Leonnatos to be
taken on by land, but at the same time he made
good his complement of men by taking in exchange
others more efficient from the troops under
Leonnatos.</p>

<p>XXIV. From this place they bore away with
a fresh breeze, and having made good a course of
500 stadia anchored near a winter torrent called
the Tomêros, which at its mouth expanded into an
estuary.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The natives lived on the marshy ground
near the shore in cabins close and suffocating.
Great was their astonishment when they descried
the fleet approaching, but <i>they were not without
courage</i>, and collecting in arms on the shore,
drew up in line to attack the strangers when
landing. They carried thick spears about 6
cubits long, not headed with iron, but what was
as good, hardened at the point by fire. Their
number was about 600, and when Nearkhos
saw that they stood their ground prepared to
fight, he ordered his vessels to advance, and then
to anchor just within bowshot of the shore, for he
had noticed that the thick spears of the barbarians
were adapted only for close fight, and were by no
means formidable as missiles. He then issued
his directions: those men that were lightest
equipped, and the most active and best at swim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>ming
were to swim to shore at a given signal:
when any one had swum so far that he could
stand in the water he was to wait for his next
neighbour, and not advance against the barbarians
until a file could be formed of three men deep:
that done, they were to rush forward shouting the
war-cry. The men selected for this service at once
plunged into the sea, and swimming rapidly touched
ground, still keeping due order, when forming in
file, they rushed to the charge, shouting the war-cry,
which was repeated from the ships, whence all
the while arrows and missiles from engines were
launched against the enemy. Then the barbarians
terrified by the glittering arms and the rapidity
of the landing, and wounded by the arrows and
other missiles, against which they had no protection,
being all but entirely naked, fled at once
without making any attempt at resistance. Some
perished in the ensuing flight, others were taken
prisoners, and some escaped to the mountains.
Those they captured had shaggy hair, not only
on their head but all over their body; their nails
resembled the claws of wild beasts, and were used,
it would seem, instead of iron for dividing fish
and splitting the softer kinds of wood. Things
of a hard consistency they cut with sharp stones,
for iron they had none. As clothing they wore
the skins of wild beasts, and occasionally also the
thick skins of the large sorts of fish.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>XXV. After this action they draw the ships on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
shore and repair all that had been damaged. On
the 6th day they weighed again, and after a course
of 300 stadia reached a place called Malana, the
last on the coast, of the Oreitai.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> In the interior
these people dress like the Indians, and use
similar weapons, but differ from them in their
language and their customs. The length of the
coast of the Arabies, measured from the place
whence the expedition had sailed, was about 1,000
stadia, and the extent of the coast of the Oreitai
1,600 stadia. Nearkhos mentions that as they sailed
along the Indian coast (for the people beyond this
are not Indians), their shadows did not fall in the
usual direction, for when they stood out a good
way to the southward, their shadows appeared to
turn and fall southward.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Those constellations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
moreover, which they had been accustomed to see
high in the heavens, were either not visible at all,
or were seen just on the verge of the horizon,
while the Polar constellations which had formerly
been always visible now set and soon afterwards
rose again. In this Nearkhos appears to
me to assert nothing improbable, for at Syênê in
Egypt they show a well in which, when the sun
is at the Tropic, there is no shadow at noon. In
Meroë also objects project no shadow at that
particular time. Hence it is probable that the
shadow is subject to the same law in India which
lies to the south, and more especially in the
Indian ocean, which extends still further to the
southward.</p>

<p>XXVI. Next to the Oreitai lies Gedrosia,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> an
inland province through which Alexander led his
army, but this with difficulty, for the region was
so desolate that the troops in the whole course of
the expedition never suffered such direful extremities
as on this march. But all the particulars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
relating to this I have set down in my larger
work (VI. 22-27). The seaboard below the Gedrosians
is occupied by a people culled the Ikhthyophagi,
and along this country the fleet now pursued
its way. Weighing from Malana about the second
watch they ran a course of 600 stadia, and reached
Bagisara. Here they found a commodious harbour,
and at a distance of 60 stadia from the sea a small
town called Pasira, whence the people of the neighbourhood
were called Pasirees.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Weighing early
next morning they had to double a headland
which projected far out into the sea, and was high
and precipitous. Here having dug wells, and got
only a small supply of bad water, they rode at
anchor that day because a high surf prevented the
vessels approaching the shore. They left this
place next day, and sailed till they reached Kolta
after a course of 200 stadia.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Weighing thence at
daybreak they reached Kalama, after a course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
600 stadia, and there anchored.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Near the beach
was a village around which grew a few palm-trees,
the dates on which were still green. There
was here an island called Karbinê, distant from
the shore about 100 stadia.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The villagers by way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
of showing their hospitality brought presents of
sheep and fish to Nearkhos, who says that the
mutton had a fishy taste like the flesh of sea birds
for the sheep fed on fish, there being no grass in
the place. Next day they proceeded 200 stadia,
and anchored off a shore near which lay a village
called Kissa, 30 stadia inland.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> That coast was
however called Karbis. There they found little
boats such as might belong to miserably poor
fishermen, but the men themselves they saw
nothing of, for they had fled when they observed
the ships dropping anchor. No corn was here procurable,
but a few goats had been left, which were
seized and put on board, for in the fleet provisions
now ran short. On weighing they doubled a
steep promontory, which projected about 150 stadia
into the sea, and then put into a well-sheltered
haven called Mosarna, where they anchored. Here
the natives were fishermen, and here they obtained
water.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>XXVII. From this place they took on board,
Nearkhos says, as pilot of the fleet, a Gedrosian
called Hydrakês, who undertook to conduct them
as far as Karmania.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Thenceforth until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
reached the Persian Gulf, the voyage was more
practicable, and the names of the stations more
familiar. Departing from Mosarna at night,
they sailed 750 stadia, and reached the coast of
Balômon. They touched next at Barna, which
was 400 stadia distant.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Here grew many palm
trees, and here was a garden wherein were myrtles
and flowers from which the men wove chaplets
for their hair.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> They saw now for the first time
cultivated trees, and met with natives in a condition
above that of mere savages. Leaving this they
followed the winding of the coast, and arrived at
Dendrobosa, where they anchor in the open sea.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
They weighed from this about midnight, and after
a course of about 400 stadia gained the haven of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Kôphas.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The inhabitants were fishermen possessed
of small and wretched boats, which they
did not manage with oars fastened to a row-lock
according to the Grecian manner, but with paddles
which they thrust on this side, and on that into
the water, like diggers using a spade. They found
at this haven plenty of good water. Weighing
about the first watch they ran 800 stadia, and put
into Kyiza, where was a desert shore with a high
surf breaking upon it.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> They were accordingly
obliged to let the ships ride at anchor and take
their meal on board. Leaving this they ran a
course of 500 stadia, and came to a small town
built on an eminence not far from the shore. On
turning his eyes in that direction Nearkhos
noticed that the land had some appearance of
being cultivated, and thereupon addressing
Arkhias (who was the son of Anaxidotos of Pella,
and sailed in the Commander’s galley, being a
Makedonian of distinction) pointed out to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
that they must take possession of the place, as
the inhabitants would not willingly supply the
army with food. It could not however be taken
by assault, a tedious siege would be necessary, and
they were already short of provisions. But the
country was one that produced corn as the thick
stubble which they saw covering the fields near the
shore clearly proved. This proposal being approved
of by all, he ordered Arkhias to make a feint of
preparing the fleet, all but one ship to sail, while
he himself, pretending to be left behind with that
ship, approached the town as if merely to view it.</p>

<p>XXVIII. When he approached the walls the
inhabitants came out to meet him, bringing a
present of tunny-fish broiled in pans (the first
instance of cookery among the Ikhthyophagi, although
these were the very last of them), accompanied
with small cakes and dates. He accepted
their offering with the proper acknowledgments,
but said he wished to see their town, which he
was accordingly allowed to enter. No sooner was
he within the gates than he ordered two of his
archers to seize the portal by which they had entered,
while he himself with two attendants and his
interpreter mounting the wall hard by, made the
preconcerted signal, on seeing which the troops
under Arkhias were to perform the service assigned
to them. The Makedonians, on seeing the
signal, immediately ran their ships towards land,
and without loss of time jumped into the sea. The
barbarians, alarmed at these proceedings, flew to
arms. Upon this Nearkhos ordered his interpreter
to proclaim that if they wished their city to be preserved
from pillage they must supply his army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
with provisions. They replied that they had none,
and proceeded to attack the wall, but were repulsed
by the archers with Nearkhos, who assailed them
with arrows from the summit of the wall. Accordingly,
when they saw that their city was taken, and
on the point of being pillaged, they at once begged
Nearkhos to take whatever corn they had, and to
depart without destroying the place. Nearkhos
upon this orders Arkhias to possess himself of the
gates and the ramparts adjoining, and sends at
the same time officers to see what stores were
available, and whether these would be all honestly
given up. The stores were produced, consisting of
a kind of meal made from fish roasted, and a little
wheat and barley, for the chief diet of these people
was fish with bread added as a relish. The troops
having appropriated these supplies returned to the
fleet, which then hauled off to a cape <i>in the neighbourhood</i>
called Bagia, which the natives regarded
as sacred to the sun.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>XXIX. They weighed from this cape about
midnight, and having made good a course of 1,000
stadia, put into Talmena, where they found a
harbour with good anchorage.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> They sailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
thence to Kanasis, a deserted town 400 stadia
distant, where they find a well ready-dug and wild
palm-trees.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> These they cut down, using the
tender heads to support life since provisions had
again run scarce. They sailed all day and all
night suffering great distress from hunger, and
then came to an anchor off a desolate coast.
Nearkhos fearing lest the men, if they landed,
would in despair desert the fleet, ordered the ships
to be moved to a distance from shore. Weighing
from this they ran a course of 850 stadia, and
came to anchor at Kanate, a place with an open
beach and some water-courses.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Weighing again,
and making 800 stadia, they reach Taoi, where
they drop anchor.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The place contained some
small and wretched villages, which were deserted
by the inhabitants upon the approach of the
fleet. Here the men found a little food and dates
of the palm-tree, beside seven camels left by the
villagers which were killed for food. Weighing
thence about daybreak they ran a course of 300
stadia, and came to anchor at Dagasira, where the
people were nomadic.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Weighing again they
sailed all night and all day without intermission,
and having thus accomplished a course of 1,100<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
stadia, left behind them the nation of the Ikhthyophagi,
on whose shores they had suffered such
severe privations. They could not approach the
beach on account of the heavy surf, but rode at
anchor out at sea. In navigating the Ikhthyophagi
coast the distance traversed was not much short
of 10,000 stadia. The people, as their name
imports, live upon fish. Few of them, however, are
fishermen, and what fish they obtain they owe
mostly to the tide at whose reflux they catch them
with nets made for this purpose. These nets are
generally about 2 stadia long, and are composed
of the bark (or fibres) of the palm, which they
twine into cord in the same way as the fibres of
flax are twined. When the sea recedes, hardly any
fish are found among the dry sands, but they
abound in the depressions of the surface where the
water still remains. The fish are for the most part
small, though some are caught of a considerable size,
these being taken in the nets. The more delicate
kinds they eat raw as soon as they are taken out of
the water. The large and coarser kinds they dry in
the sun, and when properly dried grind into a sort
of meal from which they make bread. This meal is
sometimes also used to bake cakes with. The cattle
as well as their masters fare on dried fish, for the
country has no pastures, and hardly even a blade of
grass. In most parts crabs, oysters and mussels add
to the means of subsistence. Natural salt is found
in the country, * * * from these they make oil.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Certain of their communities inhabit deserts where
not a tree grows, and where there are not even
wild fruits. Fish is their sole means of subsistence.
In some few places, however, they sow
with grain some patches of land, and eat the
produce as a viand of luxury along with the fish
which forms the staple of their diet. The better
class of the population in building their houses
use, instead of wood, the bones of whales stranded
on the coast, the broadest bones being employed
in the framework of the doors. Poor people, and
these are the great majority, construct their
dwellings with the backbones of fish.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>XXX. Whales of enormous size frequent the
outer ocean, besides other fish larger than those
found in the Mediterranean. Nearkhos relates that
when they were bearing away from Kyiza, the
sea early in the morning was observed to be blown
up into the air as if by the force of a whirlwind.
The men greatly alarmed enquired of the pilots
the nature and cause of this phenomenon, and
were informed that it proceeded from the blowing
of the whales as they sported in the sea. This
report did not quiet their alarm, and through
astonishment they let the oars drop from their
hands. Nearkhos, however, recalled them to duty,
and encouraged them by his presence, ordering
the prows of those vessels that were near him to
be turned as in a sea-fight towards the creatures
as they approached, while the rowers were just
then to shout as loud as they could the <i>alala</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
and swell the noise by dashing the water rapidly
with the oars. The men thus encouraged on
seeing the preconcerted signal advanced to action.
Then, as they approached the monsters, they
shouted the <i>alala</i> as loud as they could bawl, sounded
the trumpets, and dashed the water noisily
with the oars. Thereupon the whales, which were
seen ahead, plunged down terror-struck into the
depths, and soon after rose astern, when they
vigorously continued their blowing. The men
by loud acclamations expressed their joy at this
unexpected deliverance, the credit of which they
gave to Nearkhos, who had shown such admirable
fortitude and judgment.</p>

<p>We learn further, that on many parts of the coast
whales are occasionally stranded, being left in
shallow water at ebb-tide, and thus prevented
from escaping back to sea, and that they are
sometimes also cast ashore by violent storms.
Thus perishing, their flesh rots away, and gradually
drops off till the bones are left bare. These
are used by the natives in the construction of their
huts, the larger ribs making suitable bearing
beams, and the smaller serving for rafters. The
jaw-bones make arches for the door-ways, for
whales are sometimes five and twenty <i>orguiæ</i>
(fathoms) in length.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>XXXI. When they were sailing along the
Ikhthyophagi coast, they were told about an
island which was said to be about 100 stadia dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>tant
from the mainland, and uninhabited. Its
name was Nosala, and it was according to the local
tradition sacred to the sun. No one willingly
visited this island, and if any one was carried to
it unawares, he was never more seen. Nearkhos
states that a transport of his fleet, manned with
an Egyptian crew, disappeared not far from this
island, and that the pilots accounted for their disappearance
by saying that they must have landed
on the island in ignorance of the danger which
they would thereby incur. Nearkhos, however,
sent a galley of 30 oars to sail round the island,
instructing the men not to land, but to approach
as near as they could to the shore, and hail the
men, shouting out the name of the captain or any
other name they had not forgotten. No one answered
to the call, and Nearkhos says that he
then sailed in person to the island, and compelled
his company much against their will to
go on shore. He too landed, and showed that
the story about the island was nothing but an
empty fable. Concerning this same island he
heard also another story, which ran to this
effect: it had been at one time the residence
of one of the Nereids, whose name, he says, he
could not learn. It was her wont to have intercourse
with any man who visited the island,
changing him thereafter into a fish, and casting him
into the sea. The sun, however, being displeased
with the Nereid, ordered her to remove from the
island. She agreed to do this, and seek a home
elsewhere, but stipulated that she should be
cured of her malady. To this condition the sun
assented, and then the Nereid, taking pity upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the men whom she had transformed into fish,
restored them to their human shape. These men
were the progenitors of the Ikhthyophagi, the
line of succession remaining unbroken down to
the time of Alexander. Now, for my part I have
no praise to bestow on Nearkhos for expending
so much time and ingenuity on the not very
difficult task of proving the falsehood of these
stories, for, to take up antiquated fables merely
with a view to prove their falsehood, I can only
regard as a contemptible piece of folly.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>XXXII. To the Ikhthyophagi succeed the
Gadrôsii, who occupy a most wretched tract of
country full of sandy deserts, in penetrating
which Alexander and his army were reduced to
the greatest extremities, of which an account is to
be found in my other work. But this is an inland
region, and therefore when the expedition
left the Ikhthyophagi, its course lay along Karmania.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
Here, when they first drew towards shore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
they could not effect a landing, but had to remain
all night on board anchored in the deep, because
a violent surf spread along the shore and far out
to sea. Thereafter the direction of their course
changed, and they sailed no longer towards sunset,
but turned the heads of the vessels more to
the north-west. Karmania is better wooded and
produces better fruit than the country either
of the Ikhthyophagi or the Oreitai. It is also
more grassy, and better supplied with water.
They anchor next at Badis, an inhabited place in
Karmania, where grew cultivated trees of many
different kinds, with the exception of the olive, and
where also the soil favoured the growth of the
vine and of corn.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Weighing thence they ran
800 stadia, and came to an anchor off a barren
coast, whence they descried a headland projecting
far out into the sea, its nearest extremity being to
appearance about a day’s sail distant. Persons
acquainted with those regions asserted that this
cape belonged to Arabia, and was called Maketa,
whence cinnamon and other products were exported
to the Assyrians.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> And from this coast where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the fleet was now anchored, and from the headland
which they saw projecting into the sea right opposite,
the gulf in my opinion (which is also that
of Nearkhos) extends up into the interior, and is
probably the Red Sea. When this headland was
now in view Onesikritos, <i>the chief pilot</i>, proposed
that they should proceed to explore it, and by so
shaping their course, escape the distressing passage
up the gulf; but Nearkhos opposed this proposal.
Onesikritos, he said, must be wanting in ordinary
judgment if he did not know with what design
Alexander had sent the fleet on this voyage. He
certainly had not sent it, because there were no
proper means of conducting the whole army safely
by land, but his express purpose was to obtain a
knowledge of the coasts they might pass on
their voyage, together with the harbours and
islets, and to have the bays that might occur
explored, and to ascertain whether there were
towns bordering on the ocean, and whether the
countries, were habitable or desert. They ought
not therefore to lose sight of this object, seeing
that they were now near the end of their toils, and
especially that they were no longer in want of
the necessary supplies for prosecuting the voyage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
He feared, moreover, since the headland stretched
towards the south, lest they should find the
country there a parched desert destitute of water
and insufferably hot. This argument prevailed,
and it appears to me that by this counsel Nearkhos
saved the expedition, for all accounts represent
this cape and the parts adjacent as an arid waste
where water cannot possibly be procured.</p>

<p>XXXIII. On resuming the voyage they sailed
close to land, and after making about 700 stadia
anchored on another shore called Neoptana.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
From this they weighed next day at dawn, and
after a course of 100 stadia anchored at the mouth
of the river Anamis<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> in a country called Harmozeia.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Here at last they found a hospitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
region, one which was rich in every production
except only the olive. Here accordingly they
landed, and enjoyed a welcome respite from their
many toils—heightening their pleasure by calling
to remembrance what miseries they had suffered
at sea and in the Ikhthyophagi country, where
the shores were so sterile, and the natives so
brute-like, and where they had been reduced to
the last extremities of want. Here, also, some of
them in scattered parties, leaving the encampment
on the shore, wandered inland searching for
one thing and another that might supply their
several requirements. While thus engaged, they
fell in with a man who wore a Greek mantle,
and was otherwise attired as a Greek and spoke
the Greek language. Those who first discovered
him declared that tears started to their eyes, so
strange did it appear, after all they had suffered,
to see once more a countryman of their own, and
to hear the accents of their native tongue. They
asked him whence he came, and who he was.
He replied that he had straggled from the army of
Alexander, and that the army led by Alexander in
person was not far off. On hearing this they hurry
the man with shouts of tumultuous joy to the presence
of Nearkhos, to whom he repeated all that he
had already said, assuring him that the army
and the king were not more than a 5 days’ march
distant from the sea. The Governor of the province,
he added, was on the spot, and he would
present him to Nearkhos, and he presented him
accordingly. Nearkhos consulted this person regarding
the route he should take in order to
reach the king, and then they all went off, and made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
their way to the ships. Early next morning the
ships by orders of Nearkhos were drawn on shore,
partly for repair of the damages which some of
them had suffered on the voyage, and partly
because he had resolved to leave here the greater
part of his army. Having this in view, he fortified
the roadstead with a double palisade, and also
with an earthen rampart and a deep ditch extending
from the banks of the river to the dockyard
where the ships were lying.</p>

<p>XXXIV. While Nearkhos was thus occupied,
the Governor being aware that Alexander was in
great anxiety about the fate of this expedition,
concluded that he would receive some great advantage
from Alexander should he be the first to
apprize him of the safety of the fleet and of the
approaching visit of Nearkhos. Accordingly he
hastened to Alexander by the shortest route, and
announced that Nearkhos was coming from the
fleet to visit him. Alexander, though he could
scarcely believe the report, nevertheless received
the tidings with all the joy that might have been
expected.</p>

<p>Day after day, however, passed without confirmation
of the fact, till Alexander, on comparing the
distance from the sea with the date on which the
report had reached him, at last gave up all belief
in its truth, the more especially as several of the
parties which he had successively despatched to
find Nearkhos and escort him to the camp, had
returned without him, after going a short distance,
and meeting no one, while others who had prosecuted
the search further, and failed to find Nearkhos
and his company were still absent. He therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
ordered the Governor into confinement for having
brought delusive intelligence and rendered his
vexation more acute by the disappointment of his
hopes, and indeed his looks and perturbation of
mind plainly indicated that he was pierced to the
heart with a great grief. Meanwhile, however, one
of the parties that had been despatched in search
of Nearkhos, and his escort being furnished with
horses and waggons for their accommodation, fell
in on the way with Nearkhos and Arkhias, who
were followed by five or six attendants. At first
sight they recognized neither the admiral himself
nor Arkhias, so much changed was their appearance,
their hair long and neglected, their persons
filthy, encrusted all over with brine and shrivelled,
their complexion sallow from want of sleep and
other severe privations. On their asking where
Alexander was, they were told the name of the
place. Arkhias then, perceiving who they were,
said to Nearkhos—“It strikes me, Nearkhos, these
men are traversing the desert by the route we
pursue, for no other reason than because they have
been sent to our relief. True, they did not know us,
but that is not at all surprising, for our appearance
is so wretched that we are past all recognition.
Let us tell them who we are, and ask them why they
are travelling this way.” Nearkhos, thinking he
spoke with reason, asked the men whither they were
bound. They replied that they were searching for
Nearkhos and the fleet. “Well! I am Nearkhos,”
said the admiral, “and this man here is Arkhias.
Take us under your conduct, and we will report to
Alexander the whole history of the expedition.”</p>

<p>XXXV. They were accordingly accommodated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
in the waggons, and conducted to the camp. Some
of the horsemen, however, wishing to be the first
to impart the news, hastened forward, and told
Alexander that Nearkhos himself, and Arkhias
with him, and five attendants, would soon arrive,
but to enquiries about the rest of the people in
the expedition they had no information to give.
Alexander, concluding from this that all the expedition
had perished except this small band,
which had been unaccountably saved, did not so
much feel pleasure for the preservation of Nearkhos
and Arkhias as distress for the loss of his
whole fleet. During this conversation Nearkhos
and Arkhias arrived. It was not without difficulty
Alexander after a close scrutiny recognized
who the hirsute, ill-clad men who stood before
him were, and being confirmed by their miserable
appearance in his belief that the expedition
had perished, he was still more overcome with
grief. At length he held out his hand to Nearkhos,
and leading him apart from his attendants
and his guards he burst into tears, and wept for a
long time. Having, after a good while, recovered
some composure, “Nearkhos!” he says, “since you
and Arkhias have been restored to me alive, I can
bear more patiently the calamity of losing all my
fleet; but tell me now, in what manner did the
vessels and my people perish.” “O my king!” replied Nearkhos,
“the ships are safe and the people
also, and we are here to give you an account of their
preservation.” Tears now fell much faster from
his eyes than before, but they were tears of joy for
the salvation of his fleet which he had given up for
lost. “And where are now my ships,” he then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
enquired. “They are drawn upon shore,” replied
Nearkhos, “on the beach of the river Anamis for
repairs.” Upon this Alexander, swearing by Zeus
of the Greeks and Ammon of the Libyans, declared
that he felt happier at receiving these tidings
than in being the conqueror of all Asia, for, had
the expedition been lost, the blow to his peace of
mind would have been a counterpoise to all the
success he had achieved.</p>

<p>XXXVI. But the Governor whom Alexander
had put into confinement for bringing intelligence
that appeared to be false, seeing Nearkhos in the
camp, sunk on his knees before him, and said:
“I am the man who brought to Alexander the
news of your safe arrival. You see how I am
situated.” Nearkhos interceded with Alexander
on his behalf, and he was then liberated. Alexander
next proceeded to offer a solemn sacrifice in
gratitude for the preservation of his fleet unto
Zeus the Preserver, and Heraklês, and Apollo the
Averter of Destruction, and unto Poseidôn, and
every other deity of ocean. He celebrated likewise
a contest in gymnastics and music, and
exhibited a splendid procession wherein a foremost
place was assigned to Nearkhos. Chaplets
were wreathed for his head, and flowers were
showered upon him by the admiring multitude.
At the end of these proceedings the king said to
Nearkhos, “I do not wish you, Nearkhos, either
to risk your life or expose yourself again to the
hardships of sea-voyaging, and I shall therefore
send some other officer to conduct the expedition
onward to Sousa.” But Nearkhos answered, and
said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> “It is my duty, O king! as it is also my
desire, in all things to obey you, but if your object
is to gratify me in some way, do not take the
command from me until I complete the voyage
by bringing the ships in safety to Sousa. I have
been trusted to execute that part of the undertaking
in which all its difficulty and danger lay;
transfer not, then, to another the remaining part,
which hardly requires an effort, and that, too, just
at the time when the glory of final success is
ready to be won.” Alexander scarcely allowed
him to conclude his request, which he granted
with grateful acknowledgment of his services.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
Then he sent him down again to the coast
with only a small escort, believing that the
country through which he would pass was
friendly. He was not permitted however to
pursue his way to the coast without opposition,
for the barbarians, resenting the action of
Alexander in deposing their satrap, and gathered
in full force and seized all the strongholds
of Karmania before Tlepolemos, the newly appointed
Governor, had yet succeeded in fully
establishing his authority.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> It happened therefore
that several times in the course of a day
Nearkhos encountered bands of the insurgents
with whom he had to do battle. He therefore
hurried forward without lingering by the
way, and reached the coast in safety, though
not without severe toil and difficulty. On arriv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>ing
he sacrificed to Zeus the Preserver, and celebrated
gymnastic games.</p>

<p>XXXVII. These pious rites having been duly
performed, they again put to sea, and, after passing
a desolate and rocky island, arrived at another
island, where they anchored. This was one of
considerable size and inhabited, and 300 stadia
distant from Harmozeia, the harbour which they
had last left. The desert island was called Organa,
and that where they anchored Oarakta.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
It produced vines, palm-trees, and corn. Its
length is 800 stadia. Mazênês, the chief of this
island, accompanied them all the way to Sousa,
having volunteered to act as pilot of the fleet. The
natives of the island professed to point out the
tomb of the very first sovereign of the country,
whose name they said was Erythrês, after whom
the sea in that part of the world was called the
Erythræan.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Weighing thence their course lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
along the island, and they anchored on its shores
at a place whence another island was visible at a
distance of about 40 stadia. They learned that it
was sacred to Poseidon, and inaccessible.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Next
morning, as they were putting out to sea, the ebb-tide
caught them with such violence that three of
the galleys were stranded on the beach, and the rest
of the fleet escaped with difficulty from the surf
into deep water. The stranded vessels were however
floated off at the return of the tide, and the
day after rejoined the fleet. They anchored at
another island distant from the mainland somewhere
about 300 stadia, after running a course
of 400 stadia. Towards daybreak they resumed
the voyage, passing a desert island which lay on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
their left, called Pylora, and anchored at Sisidone,
a small town which could supply nothing but water
and fish.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Here again the natives were fish eaters,
for the soil was utterly sterile. Having taken
water on board, they weighed again, and having run
300 stadia, anchored at Tarsia, the extremity of a
cape which projects far into the sea. The next
place of anchorage was Kataia, a desert island, and
very flat.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> It was said to be sacred to Hermês
and Aphroditê. The length of this course was
300 stadia. To this island sheep and goats are
annually sent by the people of the adjoining continent
who consecrate them to Hermês and
Aphroditê. These animals were to be seen running
about in a wild state, the effect of time and the
barren soil.</p>

<p>XXXVIII. Karmania extends as far as this
island, but the parts beyond appertain to Persia.
The extent of the Karmanian coast was 3,700<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
stadia.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The people of this province live like the
Persians, on whom they border, and they have
similar weapons and a similar military system.
When the fleet left the sacred island, its course lay
along the coast of Persis, and it first drew to land
at a place called Ila, where there is a harbour under
cover of a small and desert island called Kaikander.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
The distance run was 400 stadia.
Towards daybreak they came to another island
which was inhabited, and anchored thereon. Nearkhos
notices that there is here a fishery for
pearl as there is in the Indian Sea.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Having
sailed along the shores of the promontory in
which this island terminates, a distance of about
40 stadia, they came to an anchor upon its
shores. The next anchorage was in the vicinity
of a lofty hill called Okhos, where the harbour
was well sheltered and the inhabitants were
fishermen.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Weighing thence they ran a course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
400 stadia, which brought them to Apostana, where
they anchored. At this station they saw a great
many boats, and learned that at a distance of 60
stadia from the shore there was a village. From
Apostana they weighed at night, and proceeded
400 stadia to a bay, on the borders of which many
villages were to be seen. Here the fleet anchored
under the projection of a cape which rose to a
considerable height.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Palm-trees and other fruit-bearing
trees similar to those of Greece, adorned
the country round. On weighing thence they
sailed in a line with the coast, and after a course of
somewhere about 600 stadia reached Gôgana, which
was an inhabited place, where they anchored at the
mouth of a winter torrent called the Areôn. It was
difficult to anchor, for the approach to the mouth
of the river was by a narrow channel, since the
ebbing of the tide had left shoals which lay all
round in a circle.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Weighing thence they gained,
after running as many as 800 stadia, the mouth of
another river called the Sitakos, where also it was
troublesome to anchor. Indeed all along the
coast of Persis the fleet had to be navigated
through shoals and breakers and oozy channels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
At the Sitakos they took on board a large supply
of provisions, which under orders from the king
had been collected expressly for the fleet. They
remained at this station one-and-twenty days in
all, occupied in repairing and kareening the ships,
which had been drawn on shore for the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>XXXIX. Weighing thence they came to an
inhabited district with a town called Hieratis,
after accomplishing a distance of 750 stadia.
They anchored in a canal which drew its waters
from a river and emptied into the sea, and was
called Heratemis.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Weighing next morning about
sunrise, and sailing by the shore, they reached a
winter torrent called the Padargos, where the
whole place was a peninsula, wherein were
many gardens and all kinds of trees that bear
fruit. The name of the place was Mesam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>bria.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
Weighing from Mesambria and running
a course of about 200 stadia, they reach Taôkê
on the river Granis, and there anchor. Inland
from this lay a royal city of the Persians, distant
from the mouths of the river about 200
stadia.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> We learn from Nearkhos that on their
way to Taôkê a stranded whale had been observed
from the fleet, and that a party of the men having
rowed alongside of it, measured it and brought
back word that it had a length of 50 cubits. Its
skin, they added, was clad with scales to a depth
of about a cubit, and thickly clustered over with
parasitic mussels, barnacles, and seaweed. The
monster, it was also noticed, was attended by a
great number of dolphins, larger than are ever
seen in the Mediterranean. Weighing from Taôkê
they proceeded to Rhogonis, a winter torrent,
where they anchored in a safe harbour.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The
course thither was one of 200 stadia. Weighing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
thence, and running 400 stadia, they arrived at
another winter torrent, called Brizana, where they
land and form an encampment. They had here
difficulty in anchoring because of shoals and
breakers and reefs that showed their heads above
the sea. They could therefore enter the roads
only when the tide was full; when it receded, the
ships were left high and dry.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> They weighed
with the next flood tide, and came to anchor at the
mouth of a river called the Arosis, the greatest,
according to Nearkhos, of all the rivers that in
the course of his voyage fell into the outer ocean.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>XL. The Arosis marks the limit of the possessions
of the Persians, and divides them from
the Susians. Above the Susians occurs an independent
race called the Uxians, whom I have
described in my other work (<i>Anab.</i> VII. 15, 3) as
robbers. The length of the Persian coast is 4,400
stadia. Persis, according to general report, has
three different climates,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> for that part of it which
lies along the Erythræan sea, is sandy and barren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
from the violence of the heat, while the part
which succeeds enjoys a delightful temperature,
for there the mountains stretch towards the pole
and the North wind, and the region is clothed
with verdure and has well-watered meadows, and
bears in profusion the vine and every fruit else
but the olive, while it blooms with gardens and
pleasure parks of all kinds, and is permeated with
crystal streams and abounds with lakes, and lake
and stream alike are the haunts of every variety
of water-fowl, and it is also a good country for
horses and other yoke cattle, being rich in pasture,
while it is throughout well-wooded and well-stocked
with game. The part, however, which
lies still further to the North is said to be bleak
and cold, and covered with snow, so that, as Nearkhos
tells us, certain ambassadors from the
Euxine Sea, after a very brief journey, met Alexander
marching forward to Persis, whereat
Alexander being greatly surprised, they explained
to him how very inconsiderable the distance was.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
1 have already stated that the immediate neighbours
to the Susians are the Uxians, just as the
Mardians, a race of robbers, are next neighbours
to the Persians, and the Kossaeans to the Medes.
All these tribes Alexander subdued, attacking
them in the winter time when their country
was, as they imagined, inaccessible. He then
founded cities to reclaim them from their wandering
life, and encouraged them to till their lands
and devote themselves to agriculture. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
same time he appointed magistrates armed with
the terrors of the law to prevent them having
recourse to violence in the settlement of their
quarrels. On weighing from the Arosis the expedition
coasted the shores of the Susians. The
remainder of the voyage, Nearkhos says, he cannot
describe with the same precision; he can but give
the names of the stations and the length of the
courses, for the coast was full of shoals and beset
with breakers which spread far out to sea, and
made the approach to land dangerous. The navigation
thereafter was of course almost entirely
restricted to the open sea. In mentioning their
departure from the mouth of the river where they
had encamped on the borders of Persis, he states
that they took there on board a five days’ supply
of water, as the pilots had brought to their notice
that none could be procured on the way.</p>

<p>XLI. A course of 500 stadia having been
accomplished, their next anchorage was in an
estuary, which swarmed with fish, called Kataderbis,
at the entrance of which lay an island
called Margastana.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>, They weighed at daybreak,
the ships sailing out in single file through shoals.
The direction of the shoal was indicated by stakes
fixed both on the right and the left side, just as posts
are erected as signals of danger in the passage
between the island of Leukadia and Akarnania to
prevent vessels grounding on the shoals. The
shoals of Leukadia, however, are of firm sand, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
it is thus easy to float off vessels should they happen
to strand, but in this passage there is a deep mud
on both sides of such tenacity that if vessels once
touched the bottom, they could not by any appliances
be got off; for, if they thrust poles into
the mud to propel the vessels, these found no
resistance or support, and the people who got overboard
to ease them off into navigable water found
no footing, but sunk in the mud higher than the
waist. The fleet proceeded 600 stadia, having
such difficulties of navigation to contend with,
and then came to an anchor, each crew remaining
in their own vessel, and taking their repast on
board. From this anchorage they weighed in the
night, sailing on in deep water till about the close
of the ensuing day, when, after completing a course
of 900 stadia, they dropped anchor at the mouth of
the Euphrates near a town in Babylonia called
Diridôtis—the emporium of the sea-borne trade in
frankincense and all the other fragrant productions
of Arabia.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The distance from the mouth
of the Euphrates up stream to Babylon is, according
to Nearkhos, 3,300 stadia.</p>

<p>XLII. Here intelligence having been received
that Alexander was marching towards Sousa, they
retraced their course from Diridôtis so as to join<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
him by sailing up the Pasitigris. They had now
Sousis on their left hand, and were coasting the
shores of a lake into which the Tigris empties
itself, a river, which flowing from Armenia past
Nineveh, a city once of yore great and flourishing,
encloses between itself and the Euphrates the
tract of country which from its position between
the two rivers is called Mesopotamia. It is a distance
of 600 stadia from the entrance into the lake
up to the river’s mouth at Aginis, a village in
the province of Sousis, distant from the city of
Sousa 500 stadia. The length of the voyage along
the coast of the Sousians to the mouth of the
Pasitigris was 2,000 stadia.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Weighing from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
mouth of this river they sailed up its stream
through a fertile and populous country, and
having proceeded 150 stadia dropped anchor,
awaiting the return of certain messengers whom
Nearkhos had sent off to ascertain where the
king was. Nearkhos then presented sacrifices to
the gods their preservers, and celebrated games, and
full of gladness were the hearts of all that had taken
part in the expedition. The messengers having
returned with tidings that Alexander was approaching,
the fleet resumed its voyage up the river,
and anchored near the bridge by which Alexander
intended to lead his army to Sousa. In that same
place the troops were reunited, when sacrifices
wore offered by Alexander for the preservation of
his ships and his men, and games were celebrated.
Nearkhos, whenever he was seen among the
troops, was decorated by them with garlands and
pelted with flowers. There also both Nearkhos
and Leonnatos were crowned by Alexander with
golden diadems—Nearkhos for the safety of the
expedition by sea, and Leonnatos for the victory
which he had gained over the <em class="gesperrt">Oreitai</em> and the
neighbouring barbarians. It was thus that the
expedition which had begun its voyage from the
mouths of the Indus was brought in safety to
Alexander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>XLIII. Now<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> the parts which lie to the right
of the <em class="gesperrt">Erythræan<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Sea</em> beyond the realms of
Babylonia belong principally to <em class="gesperrt">Arabia</em>, which
extends in one direction as far as the sea that washes
the shores of <em class="gesperrt">Phœnikia</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Syrian Palestine</em>,
while towards sunset it borders on the Egyptians
in the direction of the <em class="gesperrt">Mediterranean
Sea</em>. Egypt is penetrated by a gulf which extends
up from the great ocean, and as this ocean is
connected with the <em class="gesperrt">Erythræan Sea</em>, this fact
proves that a voyage could be made all the way
from <em class="gesperrt">Babylon</em> to <em class="gesperrt">Egypt</em> by means of this
gulf. But, owing to the heat and utter sterility
of the coast, no one has ever made this voyage,
except, it may be, some chance navigator. For
the troops belonging to the army of <em class="gesperrt">Kambysês</em>,
which escaped from <em class="gesperrt">Egypt</em>, and reached <em class="gesperrt">Sousa</em>
in safety, and the troops sent by <em class="gesperrt">Ptolemy</em>, the
son of Lagos, to <em class="gesperrt">Seleukos Nikatôr</em> to
<em class="gesperrt">Babylon</em>, traversed the Arabian isthmus in
eight days altogether.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> It was a waterless and
sterile region, and they had to cross it mounted
on swift camels carrying water, travelling only by
night, the heat by day being so fierce that they
could not expose themselves in the open air. So
far are the parts lying beyond this region, which
we have spoken of as an isthmus extending from
the <em class="gesperrt">Arabian Gulf</em> to the <em class="gesperrt">Erythræan Sea</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
from being inhabited, that even the parts which
run up further to the north are a desert of sand.
Moreover, men setting forth from the <em class="gesperrt">Arabian
Gulf</em> in <em class="gesperrt">Egypt</em>, after having sailed round the
greater part of <em class="gesperrt">Arabia</em> to reach the sea which
washes the shores of <em class="gesperrt">Persis</em> and <em class="gesperrt">Sousa</em>, have
returned, after sailing as far along the coast of
Arabia as the water they had on board lasted
them, and no further. The exploring party again
which <em class="gesperrt">Alexander</em> sent from <em class="gesperrt">Babylon</em> with
instructions to sail as far as they could along
the right-hand coast of the <em class="gesperrt">Erythræan Sea</em>,
with a view to examine the regions lying in that
direction, discovered some islands lying in their
route, and touched also at certain points of the
mainland of <em class="gesperrt">Arabia</em>. But as for that cape which
Nearkhos states to have been seen by the expedition
projecting into the sea right opposite
to <em class="gesperrt">Karmania</em>, there is no one who has been
able to double it and gain the other side. But if
the place could possibly be passed, either by
sea or by land, it seems to me that Alexander,
being so inquisitive and enterprising, would
have proved that it could be passed in both
these ways. But again <em class="gesperrt">Hanno</em> the <em class="gesperrt">Libyan</em>,
setting out from <em class="gesperrt">Carthage</em>, sailed out into
the ocean beyond the Pillars of <em class="gesperrt">Hercules</em>,
having <em class="gesperrt">Libya</em> on his left hand, and the time
until his course was shaped towards the rising
sun was five-and-thirty days; but when he steered
southward he encountered many difficulties from
the want of water, from the scorching heat,
and from streams of fire that fell into the sea.
<em class="gesperrt">Kyrênê</em>, no doubt, which is situated in a some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>what
barren part of <em class="gesperrt">Libya</em>, is verdant, possessed
of a genial climate, and well watered, has groves
and meadows, and yields abundantly all kinds of
useful animals and vegetable products. But this
is only the case up to the limits of the area within
which the fennel-plant can grow, while beyond
this area the interior of Kyrênê is but a desert of
sand.</p>

<p>So ends my narrative relating to <em class="gesperrt">Alexander</em>,
the son of Philip the Makedonian.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The Introduction and Commentary embody the main
substance of Müller’s Prolegomena and Notes to the
<i>Periplûs</i>, and of Vincent’s <i>Commerce and Navigation of
the Ancients</i> so far as it relates specially to that work. The
most recent authorities accessible have, however, been also
consulted, and the result of their inquiries noted. I may
mention particularly Bishop Caldwell’s Dravidian Grammar,
to which I am indebted for the identification of places
on the Malabar and Coromandel coasts.</p></div>

called <i>alaktaka</i>, Prakrit <i>alito</i>: it is used by women for
dying the nails and feet,—also as a dye. The <i>gulalî</i> or
pill-like balls used by women are made with arrowroot
coloured with <i>alito</i>, and cotton dipped in it is sold in the
bazars under the name of <i>pothi</i>, and used for the same
purposes. He has also contributed many of the Sanskṛit
names, and some notes.</p></div>

and probably from the Euxine sweep the Egêan sea, and
stretching quite across the Mediterranean to the coast of
Africa, entered through Egypt to Nubia or Ethiopia. Arrian
has accordingly mentioned the monsoon by the name of
the Etesian winds; his expression is remarkable, and attended
with a precision that does his accuracy credit. These
Etesian winds, says he, do not blow from the north in the
summer months as with us in the Mediterranean, but from
the South. On the commencement of winter, or at latest
on the setting of the Pleiades, the sea is said to be navigable

<p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Regarding the sunken reef encountered by the fleet after
leaving Koreatis, Sir Alexander Burnes says: “Near the
mouth of the river we passed a rock stretching across the
stream, which is particularly mentioned by Nearchus, who
calls it <i>a dangerous rock</i>, and is the more remarkable since
there is not even a stone below Tatta in any other part of
the Indus.” The rock, he adds, is at a distance of six miles
up the Pitti. “It is vain,” says Captain Wood in the
narrative of his <i>Journey to the Source of the Oxus</i>, “in
the delta of such a river (as the Indus), to identify existing
localities with descriptions handed down to us by the historians
of Alexander the Great ... (but) Burnes has, I
think, shown that the mouth by which the Grecian fleet
left the Indus was the modern <em class="gesperrt">Piti</em>. The ‘dangerous
rock’ of Nearchus completely identifies the spot, and as
it is still in existence, without any other within a circle of
many miles, we can wish for no stronger evidence.” With
regard to the canal dug through this rock, Burnes remarks:
“The Greek admiral only availed himself of the experience
of the people, for it is yet customary among the natives of
Sind to dig shallow canals, and leave the tides or river to
deepen them; and a distance of five stadia, or half a mile,
would call for not great labour. It is not to be supposed
that sandbanks will continue unaltered for centuries, but
I may observe that there was a large bank contiguous to
the island, between it and which a passage like that of
Nearchus might have been dug with the greatest advantage.”
The same author thus describes the mouth of the
Piti:—“Beginning from the westward we have the Pitti
mouth, an embouchure of the Buggaur, that falls into what
may be called the Bay of Karachi. It has no bar, but a
large sandbank, together with an island outside prevent a
direct passage into it from the sea, and narrow the channel
to about half a mile at its mouth.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> All inquirers have agreed in identifying the Kolaka
of Ptolemy, and the sandy island of Krokola where Nearchus
tarried with his fleet, for one day, with a small island
in the bay of Karâchi. Krôkala is further described as
lying off the mainland of the Arabii. It was 150 stadia,
or 17¼ miles, from the western mouth of the Indus,—which
agrees exactly with the relative positions of Karâchi and
the mouth of the Ghâra river, if, as we may fairly assume,
the present coast-line has advanced five or six miles during
the twenty-one centuries that have elapsed since the death
of Alexander. The identification is continued by the fact
that the district in which Karâchi is situated is called <em class="gesperrt">Karkalla</em>

flows through the present district of Las into the bay of

Cunningham identifies them with the people on the Aghor

or Aoritæ, by the suppression of the guttural, of which a
trace still remains in the initial aspirate of ‘Horitæ.’ Some

would identify with Muâri, which is now applied to the
headland of Râs Muâri or Cape Monze, the last point of
the Pab range of mountains. <i>Bâra</i>, or <i>Bâri</i>, means
roadstead or haven; and Moranta is evidently connected
with the Persian <i>Mard</i> a man, of which the feminine is
still preserved in Kâśmîrî as <i>Mahrin</i> a woman. From the
distances given by Arrian, I am inclined to fix it at the
mouth of the <em class="gesperrt">Bahar</em> rivulet, a small stream which falls
into the sea about midway between Cape Monze and
Sonmiyâni.” <i>Women’s Haven</i> is mentioned by Ptolemy
and Ammianus Marcellinus. There is in the neighbourhood
a mountain now called <em class="gesperrt">Mor</em>, which may be a remnant
of the name Morontobari. The channel through which the
fleet passed after leaving this place no longer exists, and
the island has of course disappeared.</p></div>

considerable changes, so that the position of the intermediate
places cannot be precisely determined. “From Cape
Monze to Sonmiyâni,” says Blair, “the coast bears evident
marks of having suffered considerable alterations from the
encroachments of the sea. We found trees which had been
washed down, and which afforded us a supply of fuel. In
some parts I saw imperfect creeks in a parallel direction
with the coast. These might probably be the vestiges of
that narrow channel through which the Greek galleys
passed.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> Ptolemy and Marcian enumerate the following places
as lying between the Indus and the Arabis: Rhizana,
Koiamba, Women’s Haven, Phagiaura, Arbis. Ptolemy
does not mention the Oreitai, but extends the Arabii to the
utmost limit of the district assigned to them in Arrian.
He makes, notwithstanding, the river Arabia to be the
boundary of the Arabii. His Arabis must therefore be
identified not with the <i>Pârâli</i>, but with the <i>Kurmut</i>, called
otherwise the <i>Rumra</i> or <i>Kalami</i>, where the position of
Arrian’s Kalama must be fixed. Pliny (vi. 25) places a
people whom he calls the Arbii between the Oritae and
Karmania, assigning as the boundary between the Arbii
and the Oritae the river Arbis.</p></div>

the bay of Sonmiyâni. “Sonmiyâni,” says Kempthorne,
“is a small town or fishing village situated at the mouth
of a creek which runs up some distance inland. It is
governed by a Sheikh, and the inhabitants appear to be
very poor, chiefly subsisting on dried fish and rice. A very
extensive bar or sandbank runs across the mouth of this
inlet, and none but vessels of small burden can get over it
even at high water, but inside the water is deep.” The
inhabitants of the present day are as badly off for water
as their predecessors of old. “Everything,” says one who
visited the place, “is scarce, even water, which is procured
by digging a hole five or six feet deep, and as many in
diameter, in a place which was formerly a swamp; and if
the water oozes, which sometimes it does not, it serves
them that day, and perhaps the next, when it turns quite
brackish, owing to the nitrous quality of the earth.”</p></div>

made by Curtius, Diodorus and the Chinese pilgrim
Hwen Thsang, a most competent observer, considers them
to be of Indian origin, for their customs, according
to the Pilgrim, were like those of the people of Kachh, and
their written characters closely resembled those of India,
while their language was only slightly different. The

<p><a name="Footnote_57_57" id="Footnote_57_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_57"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> Such a phenomenon could not of course have
been observed at Malana, which is about 2 degrees
north of the Tropic, and Nearkhos, as has been already
noticed (Introd. p. 155), has on account mainly of this
statement been represented as a mendacious writer.
Schmieder and Gosselin attempt to vindicate him by
suggesting that Arrian in copying his journal had either
missed the meaning of this passage, or altered it to bring it
into accordance with his own geographical theories. Müller,
however, has a better and probably the correct explanation
to offer. He thinks that the text of Nearkhos which
Arrian used contained passages interpolated from Onêsikritos
and writers of his stamp. The interpolations may
have been inserted by the Alexandrian geographers, who,
following Eratosthenes, believed that India lay between
the Tropics. In support of this view it is to be noted that
Arrian’s account of the shadow occurs in that part of his
work where he is speaking of Malana of the Oreitai, and
that Pliny (VIII. 75) gives a similar account of the shadows
that fall on a mountain of a somewhat similar name in the
country of that very people. His words are: <i>In Indiae
gente Oretam Mons est Maleus nomine, juxta quem
umbrae aestate in Austrum, hieme in Septemtrionem</i>
<i>jaciuntur</i>. Now Pliny was indebted for his knowledge of
Mons Maleus to Baeton, who places it however not in the
country of the Oreitai but somewhere in the lower Gangetic
region among the Suari and Monedes. It would thus
appear that what Baeton had said of <i>Mount Maleus</i> was
applied to <i>Malana</i> of the Oreitai, no doubt on account
of the likeness of the two names. Add to this that the
expression in the passage under consideration, <i>for the
people beyond this (Malana) are not Indians</i>, is no doubt
an interpolation into the text of the Journal, for it makes
the Oreitai to be an Indian people, whereas the Journal had
a little before made the Arabies to be the last people of
Indian descent living in this direction.</p></div>

name of <em class="gesperrt">Arabah</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Hormarah</em> Bay, and is deep and
commodious with good anchorage, sheltered from all winds
but those from the southward and eastward. The point
which forms this bay is very high and precipitous, and
runs out some distance into the sea. A rather large fishing
village is situated on a low sandy isthmus about one mile
across, which divides the bay from another.... The
only articles of provision we could obtain from the inhabitants
were a few fowls, some dried fish, and goats. They
grew no kind of vegetable or corn, a few water-melons
being the only thing these desolate regions bring forth.
Sandy deserts extend into the interior as far as the eye can
reach, and at the back of these rise high mountains.” The
<em class="gesperrt">Rhapua</em> of Ptolemy corresponds to the Bagisara or
<em class="gesperrt">Pasira</em> of Arrian, and evidently survives in the present
name of the bay and the headland of <em class="gesperrt">Araba</em>.</p></div>

probably called Karmin, if Karmis is represented in
<em class="gesperrt">Kurmat</em>. The island lying twelve miles off the mouth
of the Kalami is now called <em class="gesperrt">Astola</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Sangadip</em>,
which Kempthorne thus describes:—“Ashtola is a small
desolate island about four or five miles in circumference,
situated twelve miles from the coast of Mekran. Its cliffs
rise rather abruptly from the sea to the height of about
300 feet, and it is inaccessible except in one place, which is
a sandy beach about one mile in extent on the northern
side. Great quantities of turtle frequent this island for the
purpose of depositing their eggs. Nearchus anchored off it,
and called it Karnine. He says also that he received
hospitable entertainment from its inhabitants, their presents
being cattle and fish; but not a vestige of any habitation
now remains. The Arabs come to this island, and kill
immense numbers of these turtles,—not for the purpose of
food, but they traffic with the shell to China, where it is
made into a kind of paste, and then into combs, ornaments,
&amp;c., in imitation of tortoise-shell. The carcasses caused a
stench almost unbearable. The only land animals we could
see on the island were rats, and they were swarming.
They feed chiefly on the dead turtle. The island was
once famous as the rendezvous of the Jowassimee pirates.”
Vincent quotes Blair to this effect regarding the island:—“We
were warned by the natives at Passence that it would
be dangerous to approach the island of Asthola, as it was
enchanted, and that a ship had been turned into a rock.
The superstitious story did not deter us; we visited the
island, found plenty of excellent turtle, and saw the rock
alluded to, which at a distance had the appearance of a ship
under sail. The story was probably told to prevent our
disturbing the turtle. It has, however, some affinity to the
tale of Nearchus’s transport.” As the enchanted island
mentioned afterwards (chap. xxxi.), under the name of
Nosala, was 100 stadia distant from the coast, it was
probably the same as Karnine.</p></div>

always an achievement in the estimation of a Greek navigator;
but having now a native pilot on board, it is evident
he took advantage of the land-breeze to give the fleet an

thus described by Palgrave in the Narrative of his Travels
through Central and Eastern Arabia (Vol. II. pp. 316-7).
The afternoon was already far advanced when we reached
the headland, and saw before us the narrow sea-pass which
runs between the farthest rooks of Mesandum and the
mainland of the Cape. This strait is called the “Bab” or
“gate:” it presents an imposing spectacle, with lofty precipices
on either side, and the water flowing deep and black
below; the cliffs are utterly bare and extremely well adapted
for shivering whatever vessels have the ill luck to come
upon them. Hence and from the ceaseless dash of the dark
waves, the name of “Mesandum” or “Anvil,” a term seldom
better applied. But this is not all, for some way out at
sea rises a huge square mass of basalt of a hundred feet and
more in height sheer above the water; it bears the name
of “Salâmah” or “safety,” a euphemism of good augury
for “danger.” Several small jagged peaks, just projecting
above the surface, cluster in its neighbourhood; these bear
the endearing name of “Benât Salâmah,” or “Daughters
of Salamah.”</p></div>

was transferred from the mainland to the island now called
<em class="gesperrt">Ormus</em>, when the inhabitants fled thither to escape from
the Moghals. It is called by Arrian <em class="gesperrt">Organa</em> (chap.
xxxvii.) The Arabians called it Djerun, a name which it
continued to bear up to the 12th century. Pliny mentions
an island called Oguris, of which perhaps Djerun is a
corruption. He ascribes to it the honour of having been
the birthplace of Erythrés. The description, however,
which he gives of it is more applicable to the island called
by Arrian (chap. xxxvii.) Oârakta (now Kishm) than to
Ormus. Arrian’s description of Harmozia is still applicable
to the region adjacent to the Mînâb. “It is termed,” says
Kempthorne, “the Paradise of Persia. It is certainly most
beautifully fertile, and abounds in orange groves, orchards
containing apples, pears, peaches, and apricots, with vineyards
producing a delicious grape, from which was made
at one time a wine called Amber rosolia, generally considered
the white wine of Kishma; but no wine is made here

Oarakta, <i>Kishm</i>. Ormuz, once so renowned for its wealth
and commerce, that it was said of it by its Portuguese
occupants, that if the world were a golden ring, Ormuz
would be the diamond signet, is now in utter decay. “I
have seen,” says Palgrave (II. 319), “the abasement of Tyre,
the decline of Surat, the degradation of Goa: but in none
of those fallen seaports is aught resembling the utter
desolation of Ormuz.” A recent traveller in Persia
(Binning) thus describes the coast: “It presents no view
but sterile, barren, and desolate chains of rocks and hills:
and the general aspect of the Gulf is dismal and forbidding.
Moore’s charming allusions to Oman’s sea, with its ‘banks
of pearl and palmy isles’ are unfortunately quite visionary;

Mari Eryth. I. 1-4 and Strabo XVI. iv. 20. The Erythræan
Sea included the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf, and
the Red Sea, the last being called also the Arabian Gulf,
when it was necessary to distinguish it from the Erythræan
in general. It can hardly be doubted that the epithet
<i>Erythræan</i> (which means <i>red</i>, Greek ερυθρος) first
designated the Arabian Gulf or Red Sea, and was afterwards
extended to the seas beyond the Straits by those who first
explored them. The Red Sea was so called because it
washed the shores of Arabia, called <i>the Red Land</i> (Edom),
in contradistinction to Egypt, called <i>the Black Land</i>
(Kemi), from the darkness of the soil deposited by the
Nile. Some however thought that it received its name
from the quantity of red coral found in its waters, especially
along the eastern shores, and Strabo says (loc. cit.):
“Some say that the sea is red from the colour arising from
reflexion either from the sun, which is vertical, or from
the mountains, which are red by being scorched with
intense heat; for the colour it is supposed may be produced
by both of these causes. Ktesias of Knidos speaks of a
spring which discharges into the sea a red and ochrous
water.”—Cf. Eustath. Comment. 38.</p></div>

bay lacks depth of water; a stream still falls into it—the
Areôn of the text. To the north-west of this place in the
interior lay <em class="gesperrt">Pasargada</em>, the ancient capital of Persia,
and the burial-place of Kyros, in the neighbourhood of
Murghâb, a place to the N. E. of Shiraz (30°&nbsp;24´ N.

<p><a name="Footnote_100_100" id="Footnote_100_100"></a><a href="#FNanchor_100_100"><span class="label">[100]</span></a> The Sitakos has been identified with the Kara Agach,
Mand, Mund or Kakee river, which has a course of 300
miles. Its source is near Kodiyan, which lies N. W. of
Shiraz. At a part of its course it is called the Kewar
River. The meaning of its name is <i>black wood</i>. In Pliny
it appears as the Sitioganus. <i>Sitakon</i> was probably the
name as Nearkhos heard it pronounced, as it frequently
happens that when a Greek writer comes upon a name
like an oblique case in Greek, he invents a nominative for it.
With regard to the form of the name in Pliny, ‘g’ is but a
phonetic change instead of ‘k’. The ‘i’ is probably an
error in transcription for ‘t’. The Sitakos is probably the
Brisoana of Ptolemy, which can have no connexion with the
later-mentioned Brizana of our author. See <i>Report on the
Persian Gulf</i> by Colonel Ross, lately issued. Pliny states
that from the mouth of the Sitioganus an ascent could be
made to Pasargada, in seven days; but this is manifestly
an error.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_102_102" id="Footnote_102_102"></a><a href="#FNanchor_102_102"><span class="label">[102]</span></a> The peninsula, which is 10 miles in length and 3 in
breadth, lies so low that at times of high tide it is all but
submerged. The modern <em class="gesperrt">Abu-Shahr</em> or <em class="gesperrt">Bushir</em> is
situated on it.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_103_103" id="Footnote_103_103"></a><a href="#FNanchor_103_103"><span class="label">[103]</span></a> Nearkhos, it is probable, put into the mouth of the
river now called by some the <em class="gesperrt">Kisht</em>, by others the Boshavir.
A town exists in the neighbourhood called <em class="gesperrt">Gra</em> or
<em class="gesperrt">Gran</em>, which may have received its name from the Granis.
The royal city (or rather palace), 200 stadia distant from this
river, is mentioned by Strabo, xv. 3, 3, as being situate on
the coast. Ptolemy does not mention the Granis. He
makes Taökê to be an inland town, and calls all the district
in this part Taôkênê. Taokê may be the Touag mentioned
by Idrisi, which is now represented by Konar Takhta near
the Kisht.</p></div>

Marcellinus, who mentions it as one of the four largest
rivers in Persia, the other three being the Vatrachitis,
Brisoana, and Bagrada. It is the river at the mouth of
which is Bender-Righ or Regh, which is considered now as
in the days of Nearkhos to be a day’s sail from Bushire.</p></div>

for we have only 800 stadia specified from Mesambria to
Brizana, and none from Brizana to the Arosis; but 800
stadia are short of 50 miles, while the real distance from
Mesambria (Bushir) to the Arosis with the winding of the
coast is above 140. In these two points we cannot be
mistaken, and therefore, besides the omission of the interval
between Brizana and the Arosis, there must be some defect
in the Journal for which it is impossible now to account.”—Vincent,

It answers to the Zarotis of Pliny, who states that the
navigation at its mouth was difficult, except to those well
acquainted with it. It formed the boundary between
Persis and Susiana. The form Oroatis corresponds to the
Zend word <i>aurwat</i> ‘swift.’ It is now called the Tâb.</p></div>

Chesney, however, fixes its position at <em class="gesperrt">Jebel Sanâm</em>,
a gigantic mound near the Pallacopas branch of the
Euphrates, considerably to the north of the embouchure of
the present Euphrates. Nearkhos had evidently passed
unawares the stream of the Tigris and sailed too far westward.
Hence he had to retrace his course, as mentioned
in the next chapter.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_111_111" id="Footnote_111_111"></a><a href="#FNanchor_111_111"><span class="label">[111]</span></a> This is the Eulæus, now called the <em class="gesperrt">Karûn</em>, one arm
of which united with the Tigris, while the other fell into
the sea by an independent mouth. It is the <em class="gesperrt">Ulai</em> of the
prophet Daniel. <i>Pas</i> is said to be an old Persian word,
meaning <i>small</i>. By some writers the name <em class="gesperrt">Pasitigris</em>
was applied to the united stream of the Tigris and
Euphrates, now called the <em class="gesperrt">Shat-el-Arab</em>. The courses of
the rivers and the conformation of the country in the parts
here have all undergone great changes, and hence the
identification of localities is a matter of difficulty and
uncertainty. The following extract from Strabo will
illustrate this part of the narrative:—
</p>
<p>
Polycletus says that the <em class="gesperrt">Choaspes</em>, and the <em class="gesperrt">Eulæus</em>,
and the <em class="gesperrt">Tigris</em> also enter a lake, and thence discharge
themselves into the sea; that on the side of the lake is a
mart, as the rivers do not receive the merchandize from the
sea, nor convey it down to the sea, on account of dams in
the river, purposely constructed; and that the goods are
transported by land, a distance of 800 stadia, to Susis:
according to others, the rivers which flow through Susis
discharge themselves by the intermediate canals of the
Euphrates into the single stream of the Tigris, which on
this account has at its mouth the name of Pasitigris.
According to Nearchus, the sea-coast of Susis is swampy,
and terminates at the river Euphrates; at its mouth is a
village which receives the merchandize from Arabia, for the
coast of Arabia approaches close to the mouths of the
Euphrates and the Pasitigris; the whole intermediate space
is occupied by a lake which receives the Tigris. On sailing
up the Pasitigris 150 stadia is a bridge of rafts leading to
Susa from Persis, and is distant from Susa 60 (600?) stadia;
the Pasitigris is distant from the Oroatis about 2,000 stadia;
the ascent through the lake to the mouth of the Tigris is
600 stadia; near the mouth stands the Susian village
Aginis, distant from Susa 500 stadia; the journey by water
from the mouth of the Euphrates up to Babylon, through
a well-inhabited tract of country, is a distance of more
than 3,000 stadia.—Book xv. 3, <i>Bohn’s trans.</i></p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
